Precipitation in the Grasslands
Grasslands make up 25 percent of the Earths land surface and dominate in regions with limited rainfall which prevents forest growth
Temperature in the Grasslands
Temperatures vary much more in temperate grasslands than they do in savannas
Grassland biomes are ecosystems in which the predominant vegetation type consists of various grasses rather than trees or large shrubs
Vegetation on the African savannas for example feeds animals including zebras wildebeest gazelles and giraffes

Precipitation in the Grasslands
Grasslands make up 25 percent of the Earths land surface and dominate in regions with limited rainfall which prevents forest growth
Temperature in the Grasslands
Temperatures vary much more in temperate grasslands than they do in savannas
Grassland biomes are ecosystems in which the predominant vegetation type consists of various grasses rather than trees or large shrubs
Temperate grasslands have hot summers and cold winters
The amount of annual rainfall influences the height of grassland vegetation with taller grasses in wetter regions
As in the savanna seasonal drought and occasional fires are very important to biodiversity
