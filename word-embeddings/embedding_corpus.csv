Here are 25 Interesting Facts About Forests
I find it very interesting that the United States has more trees than it did during or before the 1940s
A lot of people say that we are killing the trees and ruining the environment and so I find that fact contrary to that
If that is true though then how are 80 of the Earths natural forests being destroyed It doesnt seem like those trees are coming from America and so do you think that you can explain a little more about where they are coming fromWe have got a lot of Tree farms nowadays
Though it has increased the number of trees there is no diversity
Miles and miles of a particular type of tree and they dont really encourage development of natural biodiversity
I like this website because it helps with my homework for school
Some things they say things about other forest
I really dont get that could someone tell me whyI really dont get itNice website but inappropriate website name
The word desert comes from a Latin word meaning abandoned
How appropriate because when  people think about deserts they mostly conjure up images of endless sand dunes and desolate stretches of barren land
These images are accurate in some places in the world but there are different types of deserts
Principally what makes a desert is an inherent lack of regular rainfall but scientists use a variety of additional factors to classify deserts into categories hot and dry semiarid coastal and cold
These factors include temperature humidity geology soil and mineral composition and the flora and fauna that inhabit the region
Rob is an ecologist from the University of Hawaii
He is also an award-winning filmmaker
As principle director of Untamed Science productions his goal is to create videos and content that are both entertaining and educational
When hes not making science content he races slalom kayaks and skydives

Dont GoBy definition deserts are land areas receiving on average less than 25
4 centimeters 10 inches of rain per year
Despite the common perception temperature does not directly determine whether or not a land area is a desert
Deserts can have high low or mild temperatures
The four subcategories of deserts are hot and dry deserts coastal deserts cold deserts and semiarid deserts
Each experiences different temperatures and amounts of rainfall
For the most part hot and dry deserts have high temperatures during the day and low temperatures during the evening
Some of the worlds hot and dry deserts have temperatures reaching 49 degrees Celsius 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the day
Others will have temperatures falling to as low as negative 18 degrees Celsius zero degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of the night
Rainfall varies among the worlds hot and dry deserts
The Sahara Desert receives as little as 1
5 centimeters 0
6 inches of rain per year while rainfall amounts in the American deserts can reach as much as 28 centimeters 11 inches per year
The Mojave Desert the Australian Desert and the Atacama Desert of Chile are three examples of hot and dry deserts
Temperatures in the worlds coastal deserts range from 13 to 24 degrees Celsius 55 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer
During the winter temperatures fall to temperatures below 5 degrees Celsius 41 degrees Fahrenheit
Typically rainfall in coastal deserts is much higher than rainfall in hot and dry deserts
Coastal deserts average between 8 and 13 centimeters 3 and 5 inches of rain each year
Still some coastal deserts have recorded as much as 37 centimeters 14
5 inches per year of rainfall
The Namib Desert in Africa is one type of coastal desert
Create the almost perfect bracket Cold deserts are associated with snow during cold winters and during summers with rainfall
Cold deserts exist in the Antarctic and the Nearctic realm an area encompassing the central and northern parts of North America
Annual precipitation in cold deserts generally falls between 15 and 26 centimeters 6 and 10 inches on average
As much as 46 centimeters 18 inches of rain has been recorded in cold deserts however
On average temperatures during the winter months range between negative 2 and 4 degrees Celsius 28 and 39 degrees Fahrenheit
During the summer months temperatures in cold deserts range from 21 to 26 degrees Celsius 69 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit
Semiarid deserts are the fourth type of deserts found on Earth
Semiarid deserts exist in Montana Russia Newfoundland and northern Asia among other places
Summers in semiarid deserts are long and have average temperatures between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius 69 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit
Temperatures usually stay below 38 degrees Celsius 100 degrees Fahrenheit in semiarid deserts
During the evening temperatures in semiarid deserts drop to around 10 degrees Celsius 50 degrees Fahrenheit
Semiarid deserts average between 2 and 4 centimeters 0
8 inches and 1
6 inches of rain per year on average
In some deserts more water is created annually from the condensation of dew during the evening than from rainfall

Tropical rainforests because of their location near the equator cover only a small area on our planet
Interestingly this region is hugely oozing with  as it contains more than half of the worlds plant and animal species
Table of ContentsThe first and most common animal adaptation in a tropical rainforest is camouflage
For an animal to successfully exhibit this adaptation it needs not only to have a color that will help it blend into the environment but also a shape that is unrecognizable by its predator
With the very dense vegetation and little amount of sunlight that can pass through the tree canopies animals can easily hide in the rainforest
But instead of hiding some animals resort to the adaptation called mimicry where they tend to look like something that is intended to be seen and not hidden like camouflage
The rainforest is exceedingly full of natural resources but the competition for these is also great
To avoid such competition some animals have developed an adaptation wherein they reduce the choice of food they consume
Aside from the production of poison per se some tropical rainforest animals tend to have bright colors and distinct patterns to scare their predators
Despite being huge in terms of area the tropical rainforest only favors smaller animals because its understory the layer above the forest floor is so dense that it makes large movements hard to execute
Hence animals adapt to this by reducing their body size and statureAnother adaptation developed by rainforest animals is nocturnality
Basically nocturnal in contrast to diurnal animals are active during the night and are usually asleep or resting during the day
The tropical rainforest is a home to numerous towering trees
Hence to make use of this great advantage some animals tend to climb up the canopies and live there

Tropical rain forests form a lush green band around the equator between the two latitudinal lines of the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
While covering less than 6 percent of Earths surface rain forests are home to more than 50 percent of the worlds plant and animal species
A tropical rain forest gets more than 60 inches 1
5 meters of rain per year although some regularly get more than 200 inches 5 meters For comparison San Diego gets around 9 inches 23 centimeters per year
The average temperature in a tropical rain forest remains between 68 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit 20 and 28 degrees Celsius
The forest floor is the rainforests bottom-most layer which receives only 2 of the sunlight
Thus plants growing here are adapted to the low light conditions and the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation
Thus relatively larger animals of the tropical rainforest like the okapi the tapir the Sumatran rhinoceros etc
inhabit the forest floors of rainforests
A large number of reptiles insects and amphibians also occur in this layer
Decaying plant and animal matter collect in the forest floor where they are decomposed by microbes like bacteria and fungi

Enjoy our awesome range of Earth facts for kids
Check out the cool trivia and have fun learning about some of our planets most amazing features

Dont GoGrassland biomes  in which the predominant vegetation type consists of various grasses rather than trees or large shrubs
Grasslands may be divided into several types including savannas temperate grasslands tallgrass prairies steppes alpine tundra and flooded grasslands among others
The type of grassland that occurs in a particular region is based on the latitude terrain local climate precipitation and wildfire regime
The faunal communities supported by these different types of grasslands vary on the basis of characteristics of the grasslands themselves as well as by geographic location
Although some definitions of savannas indicate they are tropical grasslands savannas can actually be tropical temperate montane or flooded grasslands
Savannas are characterized by grasslands with scattered individual trees and a few large scattered shrubs
Savannas rely on specific climatic regimes for their creation and maintenance including warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons
The animals that thrive on a savanna depend largely on the region of the world in which the savanna is located a savanna may support zebras giraffes kangaroos rodents insects large predatory cats elephants buffalo and a variety of other animals
Climatic savannas are maintained by the occurrence of wildfires during the dry seasonotherwise they would be taken over by later successional vegetation such as shrubs and trees
Typically the soils of savannas are thin and porous and savannas whose development and composition are more a result of soil type than wildfire regime are called edaphic savannas
Human land management practices such as farming and ranching that result in deforestation and subsequent regrowth of grasses on abandoned farmland are called derived savannas
Create the almost perfect bracket Temperate grasslands lack the scattered trees that are characteristic of savannas
Temperate grasslands have distinct hot and cold seasons and a moderate amount of precipitation in the late spring and early summer
Taller grasses dominate in the temperate grasslands that receive more rainfall whereas shorter grasses can be found in drier regions
Temperate grasslands have deeper richer soils than savannas and support a different suite of animal species including gazelles zebras rhinoceroses horses lions wolves deer jackrabbits foxes skunks and prairie dogs
The specific flora and fauna compositions of temperate grasslands are driven by their geographic location local climatic regime and soil type
Prairies with medium and tall grasses are one type of temperate grassland
Drier areas with little precipitation support the growth of buffalo grass cacti sagebrush and blue grama grass these types of grasslands are called steppes
Steppes support badgers predatory birds and snakes but usually lack ungulates and large predators
Flooded montane tundra and desert grasslands are additional distinct grassland biomes
Flooded grasslands or flooded savannas are wetland habitats dominated by grasses for example the Florida Everglades
Montane or alpine grasslands may be tropical subtropical or temperate and occur in cool temperatures at high elevations such as the steppes of the Tibetan plateaus
The highest-elevation montane grasslands are called the alpine tundra
Grasslands that grow in deserts which are defined as regions receiving less than 50 centimeters of rain per year are known as desert grasslands

Savanna steppe prairie or pampas Theyre all grasslands the globes most agriculturally useful habitats
Grasslands go by many names
In the U
Midwest theyre often called prairies
In South America theyre known as pampas
Central Eurasian grasslands are referred to as steppes while African grasslands are savannas
What they all have in common are grasses their naturally dominant vegetation
are found where there is not enough regular rainfall to support the growth of a forest but not so little that a desert forms
In fact grasslands  forests and deserts
See
Depending on how theyre defined
They are generally open and fairly flat and they exist on every continent except Antarctica which makes them vulnerable to pressure from human populations
to natural grasslands as well as the wildlife that live on them include farming    and
At the same time grasslands could help mitigate climate change One study found Californias grasslands and rangelands could  because they are less susceptible to wildfires and drought
Still
There are two main kinds of grasslands tropical and temperate
Examples of temperate grasslands include Eurasian steppes North American prairies and Argentine pampas
Tropical grasslands include the hot savannas of sub-Saharan  and northern Australia
Rainfall can vary across grasslands from season to season and year to year ranging from 10 to 40 inches annually
Temperatures can go below freezing in temperate grasslands to above 90 degrees Fahrenheit
The  on grasslands varies with the amount of rainfall
Some grasses might be under a foot tall while others can grow as high as seven feet
Their roots can extend three to six feet deep into the soil
The combination of underground biomass with moderate rainfallheavy rain can wash away nutrientsand appealing for agricultural use
Much of the North American prairielands have been converted into land for crops  to species that depend on those habitats as well as drinking water sources for people who live nearby
Grasslands support a variety of species
Vegetation on the African savannas for example feeds animals including zebras wildebeest gazelles and giraffes
On temperate grasslands  prairie dogs badgers coyotes swift foxes and a variety of birds
There can be up to  in a given grassland habitat comprising a sort of buffet where different grasses appeal to different species
Some  red oat grass and Rhodes grass in tropical savannas and purple needlegrass and galleta in temperate areas
When rainy season arrives many grasslands become coated with  such as yarrow hyssop and milkweed
The plants on grasslands have adapted to the drought fires and grazing common to that habitat
Fires both natural and human-caused are
In the U
Midwest for example  to help maintain grasslands for game species such as bison
Fire can also help prevent fire-intolerant trees and shrubs from taking over while increasing the diversity of wildflowers that support pollinators

The grassland biome includes terrestrial  that are dominated by grasses and have relatively few large trees or shrubs
There are three main types of grasslands tropical grasslands also known as  and steppe grasslands
Most grasslands experience a dry season and a rainy season
During the dry season grasslands can be susceptible to fires which often start as a result of lightning strikes
The annual rainfall in a grassland habitat is greater than the annual rainfall that occurs in
Grasslands receive sufficient rainfall to support the growth of grasses and other plants but not enough to support the growth of significant numbers of trees
The soils of grasslands also limit the vegetation structure that grows in them
In general grassland soils are too shallow and dry to support tree growth
Grasslands support a variety of wildlife including reptiles mammals amphibians birds and many types of invertebrates
The dry grasslands of Africa are among the most ecologically diverse of all grasslands and support populations of animals such as giraffes zebras lions hyenas rhinoceroses and elephants
The grasslands of Australia provide habitat for kangaroos mice snakes and a variety of birds
The grasslands of North America and Europe support wolves wild turkeys coyotes Canada geese cranes bison bobcats and eagles
Some common plant species that occur in North American grasslands include buffalo grass asters coneflowers clover goldenrods and wild indigos

Mountain goats are tundra animals that are endemic to North America
The most notable feature of these goats is their sure-footed movements on the high and steep rocky mountain ranges inhabited by them
The mountain goats are the largest animals occasionally found at altitudes above 13000 feet and usually live above the tree line in their habitat
These animals are herbivorous in nature and spend a significant amount of time grazing in the alpine meadows

Most desert species have found remarkable ways to survive by evading drought
Desert succulents such as cacti or rock plants Lithops for example survive dry spells by accumulating moisture in their fleshy tissues
They have an extensive system of shallow roots to capture soil water only a few hours after it has rained
Additionally many cacti and other stem-succulent plants of hot deserts present columnar growth with leafless vertically-erect green trunks that maximize light interception during the early and late hours of the day but avoid the midday sun when excessive heat may damage plant tissues

Tundra is described as an area where levels of subsoil beneath the surface of the earth are permanently frozen
This soil is referred to as
The level of earth above the permafrost will thaw in the short summer allowing plants to grow
This level will then freeze again in the winter and most of the plants will go dormant
Animals that live in the tundra have  that allow them to survive the extreme temperatures and conditions that are present in a tundra
There are several threats to the populations of animals that live in the tundra
Mining and oil drilling are increasing habitat loss as well as human habitations moving farther north
Global warming could be one of the largest threats to this ecosystem
As global warming melts more of the permafrost soil the very delicate balance of plant and animal life in the tundra is threatened

Although you will find some coniferous forests in warmer climates they are known for growing best in climates where there are short summers and long cold winters
Get access risk-free for 30 days			just create an account
The cones are a very important part of conifer trees because they produce seeds
The male cones produce pollen that looks like yellow dust
When the pollen blows in the wind it can land on a female cone
When this happens the seeds begin to grow on female cones
The scales on the cones provide protection for the seeds
In the winter time the scales open and the seeds drop to the ground finally sprouting in warmer weather to become baby trees

When you think of a desert do you think of a dry place covered in sand Well if you do youre right
But unbelievably there are cold deserts too that are covered in ice That sounds pretty weird but true
CloseA deserts main characteristic is that it gets little rain
There are many deserts and many types of deserts hot and cold
A few of the best-known deserts include the Sahara Sonoran and Atacama
The Sahara in northern Africa is the largest hot desert
The Sonoran is spread across parts of California Arizona and northern Mexico
The Atacama in Chile has not recorded any rainfall for more than 100 years
Desert animals have evolved to survive with little water
Scorpions are found in all deserts
Dung beetles are found in Africas Kalahari and Sahara deserts they can be rollers tunnelers or dwellers
The Sonoran desert toad is named after the desert where it lives it eats insects spiders and small mice
The collared lizard is a fast-running lizard in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts
Sidewinder rattlesnakes get their name from the way they move they can be found in the Mojave Sonoran Chihuahuan and Namib deserts
Texas horned lizards are mainly found in the Sonoran desert and desertlike areas in surrounding areas
The Texas banded gecko is also found in the Sonoran desert
Ostriches are large flightless birds in the Sahara and Kalahari deserts
Elf owl are only 5 12 inches tall and can be found in the Chihuahuan Desert
The greater roadrunner is found in the Sonoran Mojave and Chihuahuan deserts they run very fast to catch their food which includes lizards
The cactus wren is a small bird in the Sonoran desert and surrounding areas
The lappet-faced vulture is a homely bird found in the Sahara desert
Desert bighorn sheep live in the Mojave Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts

However such streams have received less attention from ecologists than streams in forested regions
Prairie streams not only are vital habitats that control downstream water quali ty but also can serve as model systems for studying disturbance ecology and related issues of resistance and resilience in temperate fresh waters
Biological responses to disturbance are particularly easy to document because prairie stream organisms have exaggerated life-history characteristics that are well suited to survival in such habitats
Understanding the ecology of Great Plains streams is imperative because they represent a component of the ever-dwindling North American supply of unpolluted surface freshwater resources and are home to a number of threatened or endangered species including the Topeka shiner  the Neosho madtom  and many freshwater mussels in the United States

The climate in the grassland is dry but not enough to be a desert
However because it is dry it is hard for trees to grow
Large trees need lots of water to survive and there just isnt enough in the grassland
Because of the lack of rain low grasses and wildflowers thrive with no competition for water from larger plants roots systems

Grassland habitats have mostly well grass You wont find lots of trees in grasslands and they get more rain than  but not as much as
Grasslands take up over 40 of the land on Earths surface
In regions that are too dry for trees to grow close together in large numbers grass dominates the landscape
Grass is a very tough plant and it grows in huge abundance so large herds of animals can find enough of it to it just one bison in north America can eat up to 15kg of grass a day

Dont GoWhat you know as the prairie biome goes by different names around the world
In South America prairies are called pampas
In Central Eurasia theyre known as steppes and in Africa theyre called savannas
Essentially theyre all the same thing a large ecological area dominated by grass
Grasslands dont have enough regular rainfall to grow a forest but too much rainfall to be classed as a desert
Learning about the climate animal life and other facts serves as an introduction to the prairie habitat for kids
Most prairie biomes are found between deserts and forests
Flat and open grasslands cover about one quarter of the Earths land although many of them have been turned into farms
They can be found in the drier parts of every continent apart from Antarctica
North America has 20 publicly owned National Grasslands covering a total area of four million acres
Historically grasslands were home to many tribes including Apache Cheyenne Santee and Wichita
Before 1890 more than six million settlers in the U
had tried to plant crops in grasslands
However the serious droughts and cold winters did not create favorable crop conditions
Create the almost perfect bracket The areas dry winds created enormous dust clouds from land that had already been plowed
Animals were threatened farmers were displaced and emergency measures were necessary to repair damaged lands and establish communities
In 1960 the National Grasslands were formed
The smallest National Grassland is McClelland Creek in Texas with 1449 acres while the largest is Little Missouri National Grassland in North Dakota with 1028051 acres
The average prairie biome temperature is about 20 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius
A prairie biome may be tropical warm all year long with a dry season and a rainy season or temperate with a warm growing season and a cold dormant season
Temperate prairie biomes such as those found in North America typically have less rainfall and a greater temperature fluctuation throughout the year than tropical prairie biomes
The type of animals youll find in a prairie biome depends on where in the world you are
In North America the main grazing animals are bison and pronghorn
Youll also find prairie dogs pocket gophers wolves coyotes swift foxes badgers and black-footed ferrets
Owls sparrows grouses meadowlarks hawks and quails are among the prairie biome bird species
Animals living in the tropical grasslands of Africa Australia India and South America include buffaloes zebras kangaroos giraffes elephants moles snakes mice hyenas and leopards
The African prairie biome has the most diverse range of hoofed animals such as antelopes in the world
Tropical grasslands are also home to large species of termites such as beetles

Grasslands have many namesprairies in North America Asian steppes savannahs and veldts in Africa Australian rangelands and pampas llanos and cerrados in South America
But they are all places where there is too little rain for trees to grow in great numbers
Instead these lands are covered in grasses and grass-like plants that have growing points close to the soil and can keep on growing even after being nibbled on by animals
These grasses can support high densities of grazing animals such as zebra antelope and bison
And these herds in turn support iconic predators including lions and cheetahs
Grassland ecosystems can support high densities of grazing animals
They are home to many familiar and fascinating species that live in herds including zebras and antelopes and the predators that prey on them like lions and cheetahs
Grassland landscapes are sensitive to disturbance
Many have been changed forever as humans have moved in and plowed the land to make room for farms replacing wildlife with herds of livestock and hunting and killing key species
Humans have long looked to grasslands and their ability to support large herds of animals as an opportunity
Grassland wildlife in some ecosystems around the world must compete with domestic livestock for food and water
In some places livestock are kept in such large densities that overgrazing and soil erosion occurs degrading the landscape
But when sustainably managed herds of domestic livestock can help preserve grassland biodiversity and avoid conversion to cropland
To feed a growing human population most of the worlds grasslands including the American prairies have been converted from natural landscapes to fields of corn wheat or other crops
Grasslands that have remained largely intact until now such as East African savannahs are at risk of being lost to agriculture
The plants and animals that live in a grassland are connected through a vast web of interactions
But the removal of key speciessuch as buffalo and prairie dogs in the American Westand introduction of invasive species like cane toads in northern Australia have disrupted the balance in these ecosystems and damaged a host of other species
Grasslands are home to some of the most magnificent animals on the planetelephants bison lionsand hunters have found them to be enticing prey
But when hunting is not controlled or is conducted illegally species can be wiped out
WWF works with local stakeholders to preserve biodiversity and ensure that natural resources are used in a sustainable manner that benefits the local community
We also work with governments and local communities to conserve and sustainably manage the water and other resources in grassland ecosystems
Because illegal hunting is a problem across central Africa and many other areas of the world WWF works with TRAFFIC the worlds largest wildlife trade monitoring network to stop illegal wildlife trade
WWF also advocates for nations to more effectively enforce wildlife laws and has trained local wildlife authorities in modern methods of antipoaching and provided equipment and provisions for antipoaching teams in several nations

Many of the large grazing animals of the grasslands such as the bison have developed flat wide teeth and digestive systems specially adapted to feed on grass
Animals small and large also have excellent camouflage to blend into the grassy landscape to try and avoid predator encounters
Deer squirrels grasshoppers and prairie dogs are all animals that have earth toned colors to blend in with the grasslands
Another strategy many of these animals have developed is to live in large social groups called herds or aggregations to increase the chance that a member will detect a threat and alert the group
An  is a group composed of many different species
Bison zebras gazelles and elephants all live in herds for protection but zebra and gazelles may also live in an aggregation together to have a better watch on predators around them

Hey kids in this video you will learn about the grasslands around the world
As we all know that the earth is the only planet in the solar system that supports living things
About 71 percent of the Earths surface is water-covered and the oceans hold about 96
5 percent of all Earths water
The earth is a home for many creatures
The animals in the ecosystem are dependent on each other for their survival this is known as the food chain process
The Temperate grasslands are found in the middle of the continents
Grasses dominate temperate grasslands
Trees and large shrubs are rarely found in grassland areas
There are many species of grasses that live in this bio-mes including purple needle grass wild oats rye grass and buffalo grass
Many animals munch on these grasses but they survive because the growth point on the grasses is very close to the ground
Popular flowers that you might find growing on grasslands are asters blazing stars sunflowers clovers and wild indigos

Information about grasslands and about the animals and plants that live there for kids K - 6Australian grasslandGrasslands are found on every continent except Antarctica
About one quarter of the Earths land is in the grasslands biome
Grasslands have different names in different countries such as pampas South America prairies North America savannahs Africa  or steppes Asia
African grassland is called savannah Getty ImagesThe main plants of a grassland are of course grasses with a few low shrubs and occasional trees
In grasslands trees are more commonly found near rivers and streams
There are many wildflowers that grow in grasslands
Flowering plants grow easily among the grassses generally flowering in spring and summer
Therefore when you look out over a grassland what you see is a fairly flat open continuous piece of land with lots and lots of grass
The roots of the grasses and small plants make the soil rich and good for farming
Grasses are plants that are found from the edge of the sea to high up in mountains and in every continent except Antarctica
Grass is a very successful plant because it can survive the harshest conditions
Unlike most plants grasses grow from the base not the top
Creeping stems above the ground are called stolons and those below the ground are called rhizomes
As these creeping stems spread out shoots grow up and produce leaves
The deep spreading root systems make sure that even in drought the plants are able to get water
Long narrow leaves like grass do not lose as much water in the heat as big leaves do
Grass can be cut quite close to the ground and new leaves blades of grass sprout from the base of the plant
This means that grasses can be eaten and walked on by animals and are not killed
spinifex Pilbara Western Australia Getty ImagesSpinifex is one of many grass species found in the grasslands of Australia
It is a spiny grass that is now often planted to bind sand along the seashore to prevent erosion
Spinifex is also the name given to a group of spiny-leaved tussock-forming grasses of inland Australia
One kind of spinifex grass is commonly known as hard spinifex or beach spinifex
It grows about 50 cm tall in clumps called hummocks or tussocks and has thin rigid leaves with a very sharp point
The seedhead goes 30-50cm above the leaves
The hummocks may be up to 2 metres in diameter sometimes with a dead centre
It grows on sandy red soils and the bases of sand dunes
spinifex grassland central Australia Getty ImagesSpinifex grasses normally grow in clumps or tussocks
In some places the grass clumps grow in rings known as hummocks
Spinifex grasses provide the ideal habitat for raptors birds of prey such as the Australian hobby Nankeen kestrel and large spotted harrier and other birds such as parrots budgerigars and cockatoos
Small marsupials such as bilbies and the Pilbara ningaui shelter amongst the tussocks
Lions dont live in the jungle - they live in grasslands Getty ImagesMany animals live in grasslands different animals in different countries
Some of them are very small such as mice prairie dogs snakes lizards and insects
These animals can hide easily in the grasses
There are also large grasslands animals such as elephants lions zebra giraffes cheetah and rhinoceros in Africa bison in North America kangaroos in Australia
These animals are too large to hide in the grasses so they must protect themselves in other ways such as by speed or camouflage
Some like African elephants giraffes and rhinos are so large that predators cannot easily attack a healthy adult

Dont GoTropical rainforests are dense forests located close to the Equator on many continents
The biggest is the Amazon rainforest in South America
Rainforests have a high annual rainfall and are hot and humid and as the largest ecosystem on Earth they are home to approximately half the animal species on the planet
Animals are found in each of the four layers of forest the overstory the canopy the understory and the forest floor
Each level provides the perfect environment for different species to thrive
There are more bats in a rainforest than any other kind of mammal
They play a vital role in the ecosystem feeding on insects distributing seeds and pollinating plants and flowers
The best known rainforest mammals are the monkeys and apes including orangutans gorillas and chimpanzees which nest in the trees
Large cats such as tigers leopards and jaguars roam the forest floor
One of the most fascinating rainforest animals for kids may be the sleepy sloth which lives high in the canopy and feeds on leaves
Anteaters suck up ants and termites from the forest floor with their long snouts
Elephants and rhinos are among the largest animals found in rainforests and mouse lemurs are the smallest
A wide variety of birds live high in the canopy of the rainforest and swoop through the treetops which reach up to 200 feet
Bright-colored parrots and toucans with their long curved bills are the most widely known rainforest birds
Sometimes birds are referred to as the gardeners of the forest because they eat fruit and disperse seeds through their dung
Birds like hornbills and quetzals also enjoy dining on lizards insects and frogs
Create the almost perfect bracket Reptiles and amphibians are found in all the layers of the rainforest
Snakes like boa constrictors and pythons live in the trees and are well camouflaged among the leaves
Crocodiles lurk in the streams and creeks and lizards and chameleons feast on bugs and insects
Bright-colored poison arrow frogs are found in Central and South America
They have poisons in their skin to protect them from predators
Heres another set of interesting rainforest facts for kids Insects are the largest group of animals in the rainforest and theyre found in every one of its layers
Beetles make up around one quarter of the worlds known animal species
Leafcutter ants march through the forest cutting off pieces of leaves with their strong jaws
Bright butterflies flutter through the trees
Millipedes clean up the forest floor feeding on dead and decaying plant matter
Dung beetles recycle animal waste by using it as food

Dont GoDid you know that 50 percent of the worlds plant and animal species live in the tropical rainforests Tropical rainforests are in the parts of Africa Asia and South America that surround the Earths equator
Another type of rainforest is a temperate rainforest which is cooler in temperature and has less rainfall than a tropical rainforest
Both types of rainforest are home to many different animals birds and insects
One of the most interesting rainforest facts for kids is that there are more insects than animals in the rainforest
While the rainforest can be a difficult environment for creatures to survive in due to the increasing loss of their natural habitat and competition for food and sunlight insects live in every part of the rainforest
They favor mossy areas decomposing dead plant matter and tree bark
There are more small animals than large animals in the rainforest and more plant-eating vegetarian animals than meat-eating carnivorous animals
Tropical rainforests are split into four zones the emergent top layer the canopy the understory and the forest floor
Most tropical rainforest animals live in the canopy which contains trees 60 to 150 feet tall because food is abundant there
The tropical rainforest animals list includes the chimpanzee tree frog monkey parrot jaguar gorilla Indian cobra orangutan leopard and iguana
Create the almost perfect bracket The largest tropical rainforest in the world is the Amazon rainforest in South America with approximately 3
5 million square kilometers 350 million hectares remaining in Brazil the largest Amazonian country
Temperature rainforests are found along the Pacific coast of North America as well as in New Zealand Europe and Japan
Temperate rainforests have the same zones as tropical rainforests minus the emergent layer
Most temperate rainforest animals live on or near the forest floor as the trees above offer protection from the wind and rain
Animals living in temperate rainforests include the kangaroo wombat elk bear puma mountain lion gray wolf Siberian tiger and snow leopard
Many rainforest animals are endangered classified at risk or have even become extinct largely due to the removal of trees and forests deforestation
It is estimated that an area the size of two football fields is destroyed every second in the rainforest
Tropical rainforest animals on the critically endangered list include the gorilla brown spider monkey jaguar orangutan poison dart frog and yellow-crested cockatoo
Sadly these species face a high risk of extinction in the near future
Temperate rainforest animals are even more at risk over 50 of the worlds temperate rainforests have already been destroyed
The endangered temperate rainforest animals list includes the bison elephant elk turtle gorilla and red wolf
The biggest threat to rainforests is deforestation
On a small scale forests are cleared to free up land for crops or grazing cattle
On a larger scale intensive agriculture replaces rainforest with large cattle pastures and commercial logging cuts down trees to sell as pulp or timber
When forests are removed and trees are cut down the animals of the rainforest lose their natural habitat
Deforestation has also been linked to drought because forests influence localized rainfall patterns
If deforestation continues at the current rate we will have no rainforests at all in 100 years

The lush and luxurious rainforest is a world like no other
These tall dense wet and warm forests are said to be the oldest living ecosystem on Earth
These forests are named rainforests because of the high amount of rainfall they receive every year

The tropical rainforest facts
The biome called the tropical rainforest is found around the equator
The rainforest is hot humid and receives over 100 inches of rain

Rainforests are exactly as the name suggests a forest that gets heaps of rain
But these forests are so incredibly important to our entire planet
The tropical rainforest is one of the worlds most threatened  despite being home to some of the most diverse and unique species on the planet
Many of the worlds most colorful creatures reside in  and animals from tiny organisms to large wild cats find homes amongst the range of plant life
Rain falling in a tropical rainforestThe reason for this climate is to do with where tropical rainforests are found
Most rainforests are located on the Equator or close to it between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere or the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere

Hi kids Are you looking for some of the interesting  Yes then dont worry because you dont have to hang around anymore
Well discover some of the hidden truths pertaining to the rainforests
To start with do you know why they are called rainforests Well simply because they have maximum quantity of rainfall as compare to the ordinary ones and the presence of huge thick trees make it unique
Every rainforest is filled with compact trees flowers and plants that make it possible to change the climatic conditions
But the darkest side of rainforests is that they are fading away at a staggering rate
Out of the two kinds of rainforests Tropical rainforests are close to the equator and are also known as Jewels of the Earth
There are four layers of tropical rainforest and the lowest layer takes in as less as 2 of the daylight
Besides rainforest facts for kids are exciting to know also because they give off as well as take in a lot of carbon dioxide which is beneficial for the environment
Esta paginá esta muy bien pero no pongais tantas ofertas para que los niñs lo vean

Alexandra has taught middle school science and has a masters degree in Math and Science Education
Want to watch this again laterPack your bag to come with me on a trek through the tropical rainforest Dont worry about bringing a coat because the tropical rainforest is near the equator which means it will be plenty warm
Be ready to get wet because these warm temperatures also come with a lot of rain and humidity
Lastly you may want to bring some bug spray to protect your skin from all the insects that live here

You may have already noticed that the tropical rainforest is full of a lot of plants There are more tree species here than anywhere else in the world
Lets look at one more closely
The trunk is very tall and straight without many branches
This is because they have to compete for the sunlight and get as tall as they can
If we make it all the way up we can see animal life as well
This is called the canopy

Dont GoAn ecosystem involves all the living and non-living aspects of the area
Desert ecosystems are unusual because they are very dry and have specifically evolved plants and animals that can survive the local climate
Learning about desert ecosystems can be fun when doing educational activities and projects about their different aspects
The defining factor of a desert is the amount of rainfall
Deserts are often hot during the day and cool at night but there is some variation
A fun way for kids to learn about desert climate is to do a temperature and rainfall map
Start with a map of the world with the desert areas outlined
Have kids research the temperatures of each of the deserts and categorize them by temperature
Color code the deserts according to temperature
Give them a clear sheet such as an overhead projector page and have them do patterns over the deserts based on the average yearly rainfall
The animals that live in the desert are specifically adapted to the environment
One desert ecosystem learning activity involves animal projects
You can tell kids about the adaptations of different animals for the desert or have them read and research them on their own
Then ask them to design their own desert dwelling animal
Kids can apply the information they learned to create their animal and then explain why their animal would do well in the desert environment
Create the almost perfect bracket Certain plants are also adapted for desert life
They have evolved to live on very little water in very hot climates
Children can learn a lot about desert ecosystems by caring for a desert plant like a cactus
This can be a project for an entire class or just one kid
Extensively research the requirements for the plant and set up an area for it that has the right amount of sun or light
Have children make a calendar for watering the plant and the amount of water needed
The most important part of this project is the planning
You can then compare the needs of the desert plant to that of a rain forest plant
A desert ecosystem not only includes the climate and living things but the soil as well
For kids learning about soil can be very boring because its all about the types of materials in the soil
One way to make this more interesting is to create small bowls of different things that can be found in the desert soil such as sand and small amounts of dead plant matter
You can set it up in proportions so that they can see how much of one material there is compared to another
Kids can then see whats in the soil and feel the materials
After looking at them individually kids can combine the materials to create their own desert soil

Dont GoA biome is a particular kind of large  or environment of living things
Biomes are described primarily on the basis of their weather animals and plants
Earth includes about five aquatic water biomes and five land terrestrial biomes
The deciduous forest biome also called the temperate forest biome is familiar to most kids who live in northern North America most of Europe and the Far East
Deciduous forest facts can be loosely grouped into information about this biomes locations around the globe its climate and weather its flora or vegetation and its fauna or animal life
Deciduous forests are found in the eastern United States Canada Europe China and Japan
Kinds can be shown on a globe or large map that all of these places are about halfway between the equator and the North Pole
Kids should recognize that there is nothing special about the Northern Hemisphere that allows this it is merely the lack of land mass south of the equator at the right latitudes that leads to the lack of deciduous forests in this half of Earth
Create the almost perfect bracket These forests are also divided into vertical zones with 100 feet being the ceiling near the tops of tall trees and the ground being the floor
Temperate means mild and the temperature range for this biome is roughly -30 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius about -22F to 86F with a worldwide average of 10C 50F
This means that temperatures rarely if ever get either extremely hot or extremely cold although winters are more severe at the cooler end than summers are at the warmer end
Again with an eye on the globe kids can learn why to expect mild temperatures in this biome
This biome experiences all four seasons winter spring summer and autumn and a large amount of rainfall about 30 to 60 inches per year
Some basic facts about decidous trees and plants for kids is that they include broadleaf trees oaks maples and beeches shrubs herbs and mosses
Kids can be invited to explain for example the Canadian flag on the basis of one of Canadas largest biomes
Deciduous means shedding and kids might be taught that baby teeth are actually called deciduous teeth by dentists because the body sheds them
It is these trees that are responsible for the beauty fall foliage because in the autumn these broad leaves do not get adequate sunlight and begin to die causing the green chlorophyll to decay into red yellow and orange
Animals in this biome cannot be uncomfortable in either very hot or very cold weather and therefore they must be able to adapt to the changing seasons
They also have to adapt to changes in the food supply and must be able to eat a wide variety of foods
Ask kids to name a type of animal they think is furry enough to live in the winter but that can also live in the summer and is notable for eating almost anything it finds
Possible answers include bears and raccoons

Forests are divided into three different layers the forest floor the understory and the canopy
The forest floor is comprised of soil dead plants and animals and small plants such as grasses and wildflowers
The understory contains small trees or bushes and is also called the shrub layer
The canopy is made up of the leaves and branches of the trees that dominate the forest

This website is the digital version of the 2014 National Climate Assessment produced in collaboration with the U
Global Change Research Program
The National Climate Assessment summarizes the impacts of climate change on the United States now and in the future
Rising temperatures are leading to increased demand for water and energy
In parts of the region this will constrain development stress natural resources and increase competition for water
New agricultural practices will be needed to cope with changing conditions
The Great Plains is a diverse region where climate and water are woven into the fabric of life
Day-to-day month-to-month and year-to-year changes in the weather can be dramatic and challenging for communities and their commerce
The region experiences multiple climate and weather hazards including floods droughts severe storms tornadoes hurricanes and winter storms
In much of the Great Plains too little precipitation falls to replace that needed by humans plants and animals
These variable conditions in the Great Plains already stress communities and cause billions of dollars in damage climate change will add to both stress and costs
Figure 19
2The number of days with the hottest temperatures is projected to increase dramatically
The historical 1971-2000 distribution of temperature for the hottest 2 of days about seven days each year echoes the distinct north-south gradient in average temperatures
However by mid-century 2041-2070 the projected change in number of days exceeding those hottest temperatures is greatest in the western areas and Gulf Coast for both the lower emissions scenario B1 and for the higher emissions scenario A2
Figure source NOAA NCDC CICS-NC
For an average of seven days per year maximum temperatures reach more than 100ºF in the Southern Plains and about 95ºF in the Northern Plains Figure 19
These high temperatures are projected to occur much more frequently even under a scenario of substantial reductions in heat-trapping gas also called greenhouse gas emissions B1 with days over 100ºF projected to double in number in the north and quadruple in the south by mid-century Ch
2 Our Changing Climate
Similar increases are expected in the number of nights with minimum temperatures higher than 80ºF in the south and 60F in the north cooler in mountain regions see Figure 19
These increases in extreme heat will have many negative consequences including increases in surface water losses heat stress and demand for air conditioning
These negative consequences will more than offset the benefits of warmer winters such as lower winter heating demand less cold stress on humans and animals and a longer growing season which will be extended by mid-century an average of 24 days relative to the 1971-2000 average
More overwintering insect populations are also expected
Figure 19
5Current regional trends of a drier south and a wetter north are projected to become more pronounced by mid-century 2041-2070 as compared to 1971-2000 averages
Maps show the maximum annual number of consecutive days in which limited less than 0
01 inches precipitation was recorded on average from 1971 to 2000 top projected changes in the number of consecutive dry days assuming substantial reductions in emissions B1 and projected changes if emissions continue to rise A2
The southeastern Great Plains which is the wettest portion of the region is projected to experience large increases in the number of consecutive dry days
Figure source NOAA NCDC CICS-NC
Rising temperatures are leading to increased demand for water and energy
In parts of the region this will constrain development stress natural resources and increase competition for water among communities agriculture energy production and ecological needs

The Great Plains is rich with energy resources primarily from coal oil and natural gas with growing wind and biofuel industries
Texas produces 16 of U
energy mostly from crude oil and natural gas and Wyoming provides an additional 14 mostly from coal
North Dakota is the second largest producer of oil in the Great Plains behind Texas
Nebraska and South Dakota rank third and fifth in biofuel production and five of the eight Great Plains states have more than 1000 megawatts of installed wind generation capacity with Texas topping the list
More than 80 of the regions land area is used for agriculture primarily cropland pastures and rangeland
Other land uses include forests urban and rural development transportation conservation and industry

Landscape fragmentation is increasing for example in the context of energy development activities in the northern Great Plains
A highly fragmented landscape will hinder adaptation of species when climate change alters habitat composition and timing of plant development cycles

disagreement or lack of opinions among expertsLand development for energy production land transformations on the fringes of urban areas and economic pressures to remove lands from conservation easements pose threats to natural systems in the Great Plains
Habitat fragmentation is already a serious issue that inhibits the ability of species to migrate as climate variability and change alter local habitats
Lands that remain out of production are susceptible to invasion from non-native plant species
Habitat fragmentation inhibits the ability of species such as the Greater Sage Grouse a candidate for Endangered Species Act protections to migrate in response to climate change
Its current habitat is threatened by energy development agricultural practices and urban development
Rapid expansion of oil and gas fields in North Dakota Wyoming and Montana and development of wind farms from North Dakota through Texas are opening new lands to development and contributing to habitat fragmentation of important core Sage Grouse habitat
The health of Sage Grouse habitat is associated with other species health as well
Climate change projections also suggest a shift in preferred habitat locations and increased susceptibility to West Nile Virus
Communities that are already the most vulnerable to weather and climate extremes will be stressed even further by more frequent extreme events occurring within an already highly variable climate system

Some of these changes are already underway and many pieces of independent evidence project that ongoing climate-related changes will ripple throughout the region
The Oglala Lakota tribe in South Dakota is incorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation planning as they consider long-term sustainable development planning
Their  plan is a partnership built around six livability principles related to transportation housing economic competitiveness existing communities federal investments and local values
Interwoven with this is a vision that incorporates plans to reduce future climate change and adapt to future climate change while protecting cultural resources
A Texas State Park police officer walks across a cracked lakebed in August 2011
This lake once spanned more than 5400 acres
Future climate change projections include more precipitation in the northern Great Plains and less in the southern Great Plains
In 2011 such a pattern was strongly manifest with exceptional drought and recording-setting temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma and flooding in the northern Great Plains
Increases in heavy downpours contribute to flooding

Dont GoA forest ecosystem describes the community of plants animals microbes and all other organisms in interaction with the chemical and physical features of their environment specifically a terrestrial environment dominated by trees growing in a closed canopy a forest in other words
The organisms involved in a forest ecosystem definition are interdependent on one another for survival and can be broadly classified according to their ecological role as producers consumers and decomposers
To describe forest ecosystem dynamics well use a well-known example of such an ecosystem as our model the Amazon rainforest of South America
Lets start our look at forest ecology where energy from the sun enters the system at the producer level made up of organisms that can manufacture their own energy from this solar input
Green plants conducting photosynthesis serve as the producers of a forest ecosystem and in the tropical rainforest of the Amazon typically arrange themselves in four layers
The  includes huge trees towering 165 feet or more that are spaced far apart
Beneath these emergent trees lies the main  composed of closely spaced trees generally 65 to 165 feet tall
They provide fruits nectar and seeds to many creatures
The  supports very few plants as it receives very little sunlight
Almost nothing grows on the  as it is devoid of sunlight
Primary consumers cant manufacture their own energy and instead obtain it by eating green plants
We call such plant-eating animals herbivores
Herbivores may eat a wide variety of different plant materials depending on their physical adaptations and habitat preferences
In the Amazon the capybara a semi-aquatic rodent forages on the forest floor and in wetlands for grasses and water plants
Other primary consumers such as the red howler monkey live in the rainforest canopy and feed on the leaves flowers fruits and nuts of trees
Create the almost perfect bracket Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers aka herbivores to obtain the energy originally produced by green plants while tertiary consumers feed on other secondary consumers
These meat-eating animals are known as carnivores and many act  as secondary and tertiary consumers depending on the creature theyre preying on
The jaguar the biggest mammalian carnivore in the Amazon may prey on capybaras a primary consumer but also readily hunts such  consumers as caimans in which case as a carnivore eating a carnivore it plays the role of a tertiary consumer
Some secondary and tertiary consumers mix up an animal diet with plant matter the golden lion tamarin for example a small monkey that will eat both fruits as well as insects and frogs
Such consumers are known as omnivores
Predators thrive in all the layers of the Amazon rainforest
Ocelots and jaguars hunt for mammals reptiles and birds on the forest floor and understory
Harpy eagles and the green snakes called emerald tree boas prey on birds lizards and mammals for food
The decomposers of the forest ecosystem break down dead plants and animals returning the nutrients to the soil to be made usable by the producers
Apart from bacteria ants and termites are important decomposers in the Amazon rainforest
Millipedes and earthworms also help to break down dead matter
The warm and moist climate of the Amazon is conducive for the decomposers to work at a rapid pace Dead matter is broken down within six weeks
The organisms of this ecosystem are interdependent on each other for survival
An example in this regard is the relationship between Azteca ants and cecropia trees
The ants which thrive in the hollow stems of the trees depend on the special juice produced by the trees for food
In exchange the ants chase away the insects that may harm the ceropias and kill the climbing vines that might choke these trees
This sort of close interactive relationship between two organisms is an example of Another example of a symbiotic relationship is the one between ants and caterpillars
The ants feed on sweet juices produced by spots on the caterpillars back
In return they protect the caterpillars from attack

Gulf CoastWetlands along the coast have more different kinds of plants
and animals than other kinds of wetlands
Millions of migrating birds such
as geese ducks and songbirds find a winter home on these coastal wetlands
The state shell the lightning whelk is found on the shorelines
Other
wildlife found in this region includes alligators fiddler crabs spoonbills
and sea turtles
The alligator is a large leathery-skinned reptile
Alligators are fascinating
animals
Their ancestors were around before dinosaurs even existed These
powerful reptiles are carnivorous meaning that they eat other animals
Some
of the animals they eat include fish turtles water birds and other alligators
Alligators are very vocal
They communicate with each other using grunts
barks or hisses
They often float with only their eyes and nostrils visible
in the water
The alligators short strong legs allow it to travel
on land
Its tail helps it swim
They are very quick on land and are excellent
swimmers
Alligators used to be an endangered species
Laws were passed that
protected them from being hunted too much and scientists studied how to improve
their habitat
Now alligators are recovered and they are no longer an endangered
species
Crabs burrow into muddy beaches or salty tidal lands
The crabs has a hard shell
over its body and eight jointed legs which puts it in the crustacean family
The Gulf Coast has blue crabs and fiddler crabs
The fiddler crab is very
interesting
The male crab has an extra large front claw or pincer
that is moved back and forth in the same way a violinist or fiddler
moves their arm when playing a violin hence its name
If the large claw breaks
off another small claw grows in its place and the other front claw then grows
into a big claw
The extra large claw is used to fight other males and to
court females
They eat algae and which are small aquatic plants
Sea turtles live in warm coastal waters
The largest of all turtles are the sea
turtles
Some sea turtles can grow as big as a car and weigh up to 850 pounds
Sea turtles have hard bony shells
Unlike other turtles that live on the
land sea turtles cant hide in their shells for protection
Instead
they have to rely on their enormous size and swimming speed to escape predators
Male sea turtles spend their whole lives in the water
The females only leave
the water to lay eggs
Females will sometimes migrate thousands of miles to
get to their breeding beaches

This grassland biome offers a dry habitat for its wildlife species
This region provides savanna vegetation Texas winter grass and sideoats grama for its native herbivore animals
The north central plains region also has the Brazos and Colorado Rivers to provide water for animals in this region of the state
The north central region of Texas is home to several herbivorous mammals desert mule deer pronghorn and whitetail deer who graze on prairie grasses
However carnivorous mammals also live in north central Texas to prey on these animals some carnivorous species include the gray fox swift fox and coyote
Smaller mammals such as rodents and mustelids badgers and weasels also live in north central Texas
Two species of rabbits eastern cottontail and desert cottontail are also found in the plains of Texas north central region
In the wetlands area wildlife watchers may see American beavers nutrias minks raccoons and Virginia opossums
Texas north central plains have a variety of herbivorous bird species and carnivorous birds of prey
Birds of prey peregrine falcon Mississippi kite and bald eagle often scour the north central plains for prey since this region does not have many forests to provide protection for its prey
The Blackland Prairie Raptor Center provides education programs on the areas bird of prey species
The region is also home to birds who nest on the ground
These birds include mourning doves Rio Grande turkeys and bobwhites
Ground-dwelling birds usually find patches of thick grass and trees to see refuge from predators

These copperhead snakes are venomous and prey on small rodents and bird eggs
Another reptile is the green anole a small lizard species
This lizard is also known as the red-throated anole since this lizards dewlap a sac under its throat has a red coloration when it expands the dewlap serves as a defense mechanism or mating call
Other reptile species include the smooth earth snake western cottonmouth snake Texas spiny lizard ground skink and Mediterranean gecko
All fish species in north central Texas are freshwater species
This region of the state has black bass species largemouth bass and Guadalupe bass and true bass species striped bass and white bass the Guadalupe bass is endemic to Texas and is the states official fish
Other Texas fish species include sucker species bigmouth buffalo and smallmouth buffalo longnose gar common carp and crappie species
Some of the largest freshwater bodies of water for fish are the Red River Lake Meredith Pilot Point and Lake Texakoma on the Texas-Oklahoma border

Dont GoThe plants and animals of the North American Coastal Plain are many diverse and some are endangered from the long-leaf pine tree to the Lower Keys marsh rabbit
With more than 1816 native plants and multiple birds reptiles mammals amphibians and fish species the North American Coastal Plain was designated an ecological hotspot in 2016 because of its native species and the threat of destruction to its ecosystem
The region received its name for its broadness and that it slopes gently towards the Atlantic Ocean
As of 2016 the North American Coastal Plains gained a biological diversity hotspot designation
Despite previous dismissal by ecologists it houses many endemic or species native to the region
But many other species introduced by humans also call it home and in some cases threaten the entire ecosystem
Because the region which is more than 400000 miles squared in area has a relatively low level of geographic diversity and a low elevation level scientists did not consider it a hotbed for biodiversity
But it meets a key criterion for the biological diversity hotspot designation more than 1500 species of native vascular plants
Some species include the critically-endangered Florida yew whose bark is used in some cancer medications the Black-eyed Susan and the endangered long-leaf pine
Of its 306 mammal species in the region a little less than half 114 are native to the region
Many of these native species belong to the rodent classification including the beach vole which ecologists consider a vulnerable species and the Florida water rat
Other endemic mammal species include the gray fox the Florida bonneted bat considered vulnerable and the Lower Keys marsh rabbit listed as critically endangered
Create the almost perfect bracket The Coastal Plains serves as home to 113 native reptile species including the chicken turtle the gopher tortoise and North American worm lizard
The ranks of the 57 endemic amphibians include a variety of toads frogs and salamanders including North Americas smallest toad the oak toad
The area serves as home to 138 endemic fish species including the Alabama sturgeon which is listed as critically endangered
Over time human intervention in the Coastal Plains saw new species introduced into the ecosystem
Humans introduced wild boars to North America in the 1900s for hunting and they have since spread across the continent including into the Coastal Plains where they cause damage to wild bird nests
Another species that poses a threat to the south of this region is the Chinese tallow tree which outproduces native species and harms the local ecosystem
Exotic island apple snails graze voraciously which harms agriculture near the wetland regions they call home
Similarly these snails often carry diseases harmful to humans
This diverse hotspot has already lost 70 percent of its original habitat
Ecologists seek to limit the harm done to the region in part by managing the invasive species that exist there

Dont GoThe Great Plains stretch from northern Canada to southern Texas and are host to a great diversity of life
Despite the limited rainfall and harsh winter and summer seasons plant and animal life thrives
These difficult conditions have sparked adaptations in the way plants and animals survive
Only some plant types mostly grasses are able to grow here year after year
Animals have had to adapt to this developing digestive systems tailored to the food available
The North American Great Plains account for one quarter of the continents land area
Plant and animal types vary by location and climate
In the north long cold winters and short summers make living conditions difficult
In the south hot summers and short cool periods create similar though opposite challenges
The Rocky Mountains to the west of the Great Plains cast a rain shadow on much of the western prairie
As a result vegetation is less prolific and animal life is more sparse
In the east rain is more abundant and vegetation grows tall offering plenty of food for animals
Human development has changed the majority of the landscape
The original grasslands of the prairie are no longer there with the exception of reserves and parks
Farms cities and other forms of human development have altered the landscape
Animals such as buffalo which once inhabited the land in the millions have been severely depleted from hunting and food shortages
The buffalo population is now represented by the few remaining American bison which were reintroduced through conservation and breeding efforts
Create the almost perfect bracket The dominant plant life in the Great Plains is grasses
Although much of the original grasses in the plains have been lost to human development nature preserves and parks host landscapes that show how the ecology of the land once looked
Eastern regions feature taller grasses reaching heights of 12 feet
Often these are either switch grass or big bluestem grass
Sagebrush and a short grass called buffalo grass are common in the western sections of the plains
Many animals found in the Great Plains have become iconic of the region
American bison prairie dogs jackrabbits and coyotes are common sights among the prairie grasses
Grazing animals do well in the region flourishing among the abundant grasses
Pronghorn sheep which are often mistaken for a type of antelope are the only antelope-like animal in North America
Carnivores take advantage of the herbivores throughout the plains
Wolves coyotes and foxes feed on many of the animals they find grazing or popping up among the grasses
Rattlesnakes can be found throughout the region
All these animals face harsh conditions throughout the year
Both plants and animals in the Great Plains have evolved and adapted to a special relationship with one another
Animals such as bison have developed special stomachs that allow them to digest otherwise difficult-to-process grasses
The cellulose in these and other plants are difficult for animals to break down and the extensive digestive systems in grazing animals allow them to survive on this diet
Plants rather than developing a defense mechanism to protect themselves from herbivores have evolved into heavily rooted organisms
Their extensive roots grow deep and numerous in the ground
They allow for consistent growth despite constant consumption of their leaves

One of only four remaining temperate grasslands in the world the Northern Great Plains ecoregion spans five US states and two Canadian provinces across 279000 square miles of mixed-grass prairie
Two hundred years ago bison black-footed ferrets pronghorn antelope and grassland birds thrived on the landscape alongside Native American tribes the regions original land stewards
Today the sights and sounds of the prairie are threatened by habitat fragmentation resource extraction and plow-up for crop agriculture
In many places the species that shaped the American West are struggling to adapt and survive
Since 2000 WWF has worked in this part of the country to conserve and restore the regions natural heritage and native wildlife
So which animals call this beautiful region home and why do they matterStrong and majestic plains bison once numbered 30 million to 60 million in North America but their population plummeted during westward expansion in the 1880s
Today WWF works with Native Americans and other partners to establish and grow herds so they will once again flourish in parts of the region
About 300 of these masked bandits still live in the wild in the Great Plainsa vast improvement considering they were once thought to be extinct
Habitat loss and disease still threaten the species but WWF and partners help maintain existing ferret sites establish new sites and research ways to address the non-native disease the black-footed ferrets battle
Black-footed ferrets are largely dependent on prairie dog towns for shelter and food
These dignified prairie birds perform elaborate mating dances on areas they have used for hundreds of years
Habitat degradation associated with energy development such as wells roads power lines and buildings decrease sage-grouse nesting success
WWF has modeled how climate change conditions will impact these animals and their habitat and is working with government agencies to ensure they remain viable into the future
Birders who try to find Mountain Plovers refer to them as Prairie Ghosts as they disappear into their surroundings with their coloration
The Mountain Plover is just larger than an American Robin and is one of nine grassland bird species that breed nowhere else other than the Great Plains
In the northern Great Plains Mountain Plovers nest primarily in prairie dog towns
Mountain Plovers have lost much of their breeding habitat due to the removal of prairie dog towns by humans and disease

The Northern Great Plains spans more than 180 million acres and crosses five U
states and two Canadian provinces
As large as California and Nevada combined this short- and mixed-grass prairie is one of only four remaining intact temperate grasslands in the world
Two hundred years ago bison pronghorn black-footed ferrets and a diverse array of grassland birds thrived across the Northern Great Plains
While mapping and exploring the region Lewis and Clark were awestruck noting the immence sic herds of Buffaloe sic deer Elk and Antelopes which we saw in every direction feeding on the hills and plains
The diverse wildlife that roamed these vast grasslands are not lost
They still call this place home but their calls are muted and tracks and nests less abundant
WWF is working to restore this living prairie in the heart of North America
At the crux of our vision is a mosaic of private public and tribal lands managed in a manner that benefits wildlife and local communities
We work with the ranching community public agencies tribal nations and other conservation partners to ensure that the richness of the prairie ecosystem is sustained and enhanced for future generations to enjoy
WWF is committed to identifying conservation solutions that bolster economic opportunities for the people and communities who call this region home
We recognize that conserving the Northern Great Plains goes hand-in-hand with sustaining the rural communities who live here
WWF supports grasslands and those who live here identifying conservation solutions that help both thrive
Growing concerns about the ongoing destruction of the Northern Great Plains has resulted in an expanding number of organizations and agencies joining in partnerships to coordinate their conservation work
WWF works closely with these interests through formal joint ventures cooperatives networks and smaller partnerships to scale up and magnify our conservation investments
Most of the Northern Great Plains ecoregion is comprised of private land94 million acres of which remain as intact grassland
Some families in the region have been ranching their land for more than 150 years
Keeping ranchers in business leaves grasslands intact creates habitat for a broad diversity of birds and other grassland species moderates run-off and secures carbon in the soil
Celebrating a black-footed ferret release in SaskatchewanNative Americans are this regions original land stewards
Today tribes manage roughly 9 million acres of the Northern Great Plains ecoregion much of which is rich in biodiversity and astoundingly beautiful
Most tribal communities in the Northern Great Plains see a unique cultural and spiritual significance to sustaining grasslands and restoring wildlife
WWF helps tribes achieve conservation success while improving the lives of their communities
Oil and gas development on the Northern Great Plains
The Northern Great Plains was shaped by change
Seasonal migrations of millions of bison kicking up dust and grass
Frigid winters high winds and blistering summers
Spring rainstorms intense dry lightening outbreaks and rampaging rivers or racing wildfires
But now modern changes threaten the wildlife and land in the Northern Great Plains
Originally the region was a sea of rich grasses watersheds and wildflowers
Today demand for agricultural commodities and new drought resistant bioengineered crops encourage the degradation of native grasslands and drain waterways and watersheds
This plow-up of native grasslands will continue to reshape the landscape and push out wildlife if conservation is not considered
Large tractor seeding newly plowed prairie
From seasonal migrations across state or country boundaries to moving between nesting and feeding grounds wildlife need the freedom to roam for survival
Development roads and fences habitat clearing and invasive plant species restrict wildlifes ability to adapt move find mates and food and thrive
Oil Well North Dakota Bakken FormationEnergy development pressure in the Northern Great Plains comes from both traditional oil gas and coal and renewable sources
Some of the nations largest coal reserves exist in the region and wind energy development is growing across every state in the NGP
Advances in oil and gas extraction allow industry to tap into parts of the region where resources were once too difficult and expensive to access
The oil and gas industry is taking advantage of these new technologies and breaking ground from the Dakotas to areas as far west as the Rockies
In North Dakota the Bakken Shale Formation has produced over a million barrels per day in recent years
The incredible amount of oil underlying the Bakken has led North Dakota to become the second highest oil producing state in the country after Texas
As technology continues to improve oil and gas development will continue to boom in the region fragmenting the grasslands and threatening its wildlife
Wind farm constructed on disturbed land
Renewable energy is growing across the Northern Great Plains
The high wind speeds in parts of the NGP have led to nicknames like the Saudi Arabia of wind and several states in the ecoregion have exceptional wind potential
Wind energys increasingly competitive prices and federal and state policies meant to drive its development have led to a wind boom across the NGP
In 2013 South Dakota generated 26 of its energy from wind while North Dakota and Wyoming generated 15
6 and 8
4 respectively
Wyoming is also in the process of developing the largest wind farm in the country and possibly the world with 1000 planned turbines on public and private lands
More wind energy means less of a dependence on coal less carbon dioxide emitted and less water consumed
However while increasing wind energy and other renewables means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels wind farms can still have a significant impact on a landscape through bird and bat mortalities habitat fragmentation and wildlife disturbance
In the Northern Great Plains WWF predicts erratic weather will result in more extreme levels of heat snow and rain severe floods and droughts
Land managers will need to change how they plan implement evaluate and carry forward their land use plans to make ends meet in the face of climate change

WWFs science team continually refines planning models used to focus and prioritize our conservation actions
Ecoregional and landscape-level progress is tracked toward our conservation goals in the Northern Great Plains
We use cutting-edge techniques to model species richness assess future threats and predict patterns of change across the region
WWF has been a science leader engaging a variety of partners working in this region and we continue to hold a high standard for designing smart strategy and updating planning as the world changes
WWF works with the ranching community to make livestock production more sustainable for the environment while identifying and promoting new market opportunities for sustainability across the beef supply chain
We currently work with a group of ranchers in Montana Nebraska and South Dakota to collect baseline information to drive improvements in management of lands grazed by cattle
Our work will inform market-based efforts for sustainably produced beef nation-wide and within guidelines agreed to globally
Moving forward our goal is to build strong partnerships with ranchers providing them with the resources needed to sustainably steward their lands as part of the broader ecosystem
This will improve the ecological function of large grassland landscapes and contribute to the economic viability of their operations
WWF partners with several tribal nations throughout the Northern Great Plains to restore species improve capacity and to build more sustainable financing for tribal wildlife programs
Many tribes are seeking to increase technical capacity to manage reservation lands for wildlife an area where WWF is able to provide important support
WWF helps tribal nations in South Dakota and Montana to develop and implement comprehensive wildlife management plans
We bring technical and financial resources so tribal nations can retain biologists enhance technical capabilities and restore wildlife in a way that can manage at scaleespecially tribal bison herds and populations of the highly endangered black-footed ferret
Public lands contain some of the most iconic landscapes of the Northern Great Plains including nearly 23 million acres of intact grassland
Yet these lands face growing threats of disturbance as energy and other development encroaches
WWF works to ensure that public land management plans protect these vast areas that serve as vital habitat for speciessuch as  and mule deerand comprise some of the best remaining habitat for declining grassland bird species like the Spragues pipit
Many of these lands also provide crucial grazing resources for neighboring ranching communities
Through our public lands program we continue to partner with leaders in public land management at the national and local levels bringing influence and resources to bear so that these ecosystems are adequately protected

Dont GoThe Great Plains in the middle of the United States may be flat but dont think of the area as boring
There is a surprising diversity to the landscape from the Badlands of the Dakotas to the flat-top mesas of Texas
Sweeping vistas of farmland and grasslands and a rich diversity of animal and plant life add to the beauty and interest of the Great Plains
There is also a rich history as the land was once forested and in part covered with glaciers
The Great Plains are exceptionally flat because they used to be the bed of what was once the interior sea
The Great Plains were completely submerged 570 million years ago
As the tectonic plates began to shift and the North American continent thrust upward the sea flowed away exposing the Plains
Rivers glaciers wind and continued continental uplift shaped the Plains over the course of hundreds of millions of years although most of the modern formations were created within the last two million years
Geologically speaking the Great Plains are a relatively young environment
Create the almost perfect bracket Because the Great Plains are so vast they have a variety of stunning geological formations
For instance in central Texas there is a sudden upthrust of land in the middle of otherwise level plains
However the uplift itself is so extremely flat that early settlers named it the Llano Estacado Staked Plain because they had to mark their land by stakes there were no natural landmarks by which to separate settlements
Farther north are the Badlands of South Dakota
The Badlands are a series of flat-topped rocks in which gullying has taken place creating uneven valleys
The formation was created because the land is made of clay-rich material such as shale which water cannot penetrate
Rain runoff over the eons chipped away at the surface of the rock creating the valleys
The Great Plains are also home to the High Plains or Ogallala Aquifer which spans from Canada all the way to Texas
As one of the largest sources of fresh water in the world its thought to hold one quadrillion gallons of water
The Great Plains are primarily grasslands
In particular they are mostly covered with short grasses such as blue grama and buffalograss
These short grasses abound because the land has so long been used as grazing pasture for livestock which favor such grass as feed
Although the Plains are now almost totally covered by grasslands they were not always so
Prior to the last ice age ten millennia ago there were many trees and perhaps even forests across the landscape
However as the ice retreated the climate that remained was semi-arid leaving the land predisposed to grasses
In the Great Plains bison are the largest and most recognizable animals
Although once 60 million strong their numbers have now dwindled to 20000 making them among the most threatened species on the Plains
Other animals include black-footed ferrets and pronghorn antelope as well as many species of grassland birds such as grouse hawks and vultures
The Plains are also home to many species of bat foxes and deer

Posted by Possibly the most graceful and majestic animal on the continenthave been the objective of many hunters over the years
Greater Kudu are probably best known for their extremely long spiraling horns
The size of the horn varies but most adult kudu bulls have horns that measure 45-55 inches with exceptional kudu having horns around 70 long
Kudu are among the largest antelope on the continent and usually weigh 600-700 pounds
However they are exceptionally nimble for an animal of their size
Known as the Grey Ghost kudu are can be
They inhabit thickly wooded areas from Tanzania down through Mozambique Zimbabwe South Africa and Namibia
Of these places South Africas Limpopo Province has perhaps theanywhere in Africa
Due to their distinctive black and white stripesare one of the most recognizable animals in Africa
Weighing up to 800 pounds zebra are a species of equids that are somewhat related to horses and donkeys
Though they do not have horns zebra are often hunted for their unique hides
Since they are also a food source for many predators in Africa zebra are also hunted to use as bait when hunting leopard and lion
are a large species of antelope and usually weigh 500-700 pounds
Both male and female gemsbok have long straight horns
However males usually have horns that are shorter and thicker than the horns on females
This makes the Gemsbok unusual because females are often pursued instead of males for their longer more desirable horns
Gemsbok inhabit arid regions of the Kalahari Desert and its surrounding regions in Namibia Botswana and South Africa
They are well adapted to life in arid and semi-arid environments and do not need to drink water in order to survive as they can fulfill all of their water needs through the foods they eat
Gemsbok are also known for being extremely resilient animals and can be very tough to bring down
The first member of the Big 5 species of big game on the list Cape Buffalo are aamong hunters journeying to Africa
Distantly related to domesticated cattle Cape Buffalo are known for being extremely large tough and ill tempered
Big bulls can weigh nearly 2000 pounds have large horns that sweep down before curving upwards and to the rear
Similar in some ways to impalaare a medium sized species of antelope that usually weigh 75-100 pounds
Like Gemsbok they inhabit arid and semi-arid areas of South Africa Botswana and Namibia
Depending on the season they are either grazers or browsers and are often seen in large herds of up to several hundred animals on the open grasslands of their habitat
They also get all the water they need from their foods and do not need to drink water to survive
Springbok are known for their extremely tasty meat and beautiful hides
Theis a medium sized member of the pig family and typically weighs 150-300 pounds
They are found all over Africa except for dense forests and deserts
They are among the most reliant of all species in Africa on water and must drink daily to survive
Unfortunately this also means they are among the first animals to suffer during an extended drought
Theis the largest species of antelope in the world and big bulls may weigh in excess of 2200 pounds bigger than a Cape Buffalo
Eland are also a species of spiral horned antelope and both males and females have horns though the horns on a female are smaller than those on a male
Eland inhabit large portions of central eastern and southern Africa
They usually live in small herds and are found almost everywhere except for thick forests deserts and swamps
They are well adapted to both grazing and browsing and will vary their diet according to the season
Eland are also very mild mannered and they may be domesticated
Finally eland are also well known for their delicious meat

An estimated 50 million American bison once roamed the Great Plains and throughout many other parts of the US
Weighing as much as a ton and standing as tall as 6 feet at their shoulders the bison was hunted to the brink of extinction in the U
during the 1800s for its hide
Today herds of bison also called buffalo reside on the Great Plains but they are far less numerous than they were before European settlers made their way west
Ungulates such as the elk the white-tailed deer and the mule deer also exist here as does the pronghorn antelope the fastest land animal in North America and one of the fastest in the world

About the American BisonBison symbolic animals of the Great Plains are often mistakenly called buffaloes
By any name they are formidable beasts and the heaviest land animals in North America
Bison stand some 5 to 6
5 feet tall at the shoulder and can tip the scales at over a ton
Despite their massive size bison are quick on their feet
When the need arises they can run at speeds up to 40 miles an hour
They sport curved sharp horns that may grow to be two feet long
These large grazers feed on plains grasses herbs shrubs and twigs
They regurgitate their food and chew it as cud before final digestion
Females cows and adult males bulls generally live in small separate bands and come together in very large herds during the summer mating season
Males battle for mating primacy but such contests rarely turn dangerous
Females give birth to one calf after a nine-month pregnancy
Bison once covered the Great Plains and much of North America and were critically important to Plains Indian societies
During the 19th century settlers killed some 50 million bison for food sport and to deprive Native Americans of their most important natural asset
The once enormous herds were reduced to only a few hundred animals
Today bison numbers have rebounded somewhat and about 500000 bison live on preserves and ranches where they are raised for their meat

Dont GoMost people can recognize a zebra at a glance the distinctive black stripes on a horse-like frame are often synonymous with imagined visions of an African safari
Details about the zebra including its physical characteristics and herd behavior are less well-known
It may come as a surprise to some for example that one species of zebra Grevys is endangered due to the loss of its habitat to agriculture
There are three species of zebra in Africa
The most populous is the plains or Burchells zebra
The other two species are Grevys which is named for an 1880s French president who received one of the zebras as a gift and the mountain zebra
The Grevys zebra now competes with livestock for water resources as agricultural land has taken over much of its natural habitat
According to the African Wildlife Foundation the Grevys zebras now number approximately 2500 a few decades ago 15000 of them existed
Burchells zebras inhabit savannas in East Africa in a variety of landscapes from grasslands to woodlands
Grevys are mostly found now only in Northern Kenya
The mountain zebra lives in Southern and Southwestern Africa
Create the almost perfect bracket Zebras are plant eaters and can live up to 40 years in captivity
Grevys zebras are taller and heavier than their Burchells counterparts A Grevys zebra can be as tall as 50 to 60 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 770 and 990 lbs
Burchells are about 45 to 55 inches high and weigh between 485 and 550 lbs
The mountain zebra is built like a donkey and has an extra flap of skin on its throat
All zebras stripes form a camouflage that makes them seem further away or difficult to see at times of day when predators are most active
Burchells zebras roam in organized social groups led by a stallion which cares for a small group of mares and their foals
The mares remain together even after the stallion dies and is replaced by another
Males form bonds with other males and very large groups will migrate together led by the oldest females to find new sources of grass and water
The Grevys zebras are instead solitary and claim territory and mate with the females whom they encounter within that territory

About the Plains ZebraNo animal has a more distinctive coat than the zebra
Each animals stripes are as unique as fingerprintsno two are exactly alikealthough each of the three species has its own general pattern
Why do zebras have stripes at all Scientists arent sure but many theories center on their utility as some form of camouflage
The patterns may make it difficult for predators to identify a single animal from a running herd and distort distance at dawn and dusk
Or they may dissuade insects that recognize only large areas of single-colored fur or act as a kind of natural sunscreen
Because of their uniqueness stripes may also help zebras recognize one another
Zebras are social animals that spend time in herds
They graze together primarily on grass and even groom one another
Plains zebras are the most common species
They live in small family groups consisting of a male stallion several females and their young
These units may combine with others to form awe-inspiring herds thousands of head strong but family members will remain close within the herd
Zebras must be constantly wary of lions and hyenas
A herd has many eyes alert to danger
If an animal is attacked its family will come to its defense circling the wounded zebra and attempting to drive off predators

Plains Grassland Ecosystem
x0 full size   Gulf Coastal Plain Ecosystem Partnership GCPEPFor over 20 years our partnership has focused on the conservation and restoration of the Longleaf pine ecosystem
The Gulf Coastal Plain Ecosystem Partnership GCPEP was formed in 1996 to conserve and restore the dwindling longleaf pine ecosystem
The seven public and private landowners agreed to work together to further that goal and began the effort by enrolling over 840000 acres of their lands in GCPEP
The partners recognized early on that success would depend upon both internal and external collaboration and that there would have to be a focus on protection restoration management and public outreach and education
Over the 20 years since the partnership was formed GCPEP has grown to thirteen partners and over 1
25 million acres
Within the GCPEP landscape protection restoration and management of longleaf pine has improved dramatically over that period
GCPEP staff and partners have supported the longleaf conservation effort using a variety of conservation tools and strategies

Permafrost is a layer of frozen soil and dead plants that extends some 1476 feet 450 meters below the surface
In much of the Arctic it is frozen year-round
In the southern regions of the Arctic the surface layer above the permafrost melts during the summer and this forms bogs and shallow lakes that invite an explosion of animal life
Insects swarm around the bogs and millions of migrating birds come to feed on them

Until recently the tundra acted as a carbon sink and captured huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis
That process helped keep the amount of this greenhouse gas from accumulating in the atmosphere
Today however as the permafrost melts and dead plant material decomposes and releases greenhouse gases the tundra has flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon contributor
That means not only is the planet less capable of preventing greenhouse gases from accumulating but the tundra is also contributing to their buildup
Scientists are still learning about what else the permafrost harbors and what could be released as it thaws

Ims Eva Fuglei Trophic Interaction Cycles in Tundra Ecosystems and the Impact of Climate Change  Volume 55 Issue 4 April 2005 Pages 311322 -to-year variation in terms of bioproduction
In some years wildlife populations flourish while in others the tundra appears remarkably devoid of wildlife
Although indigenous people and early explorers have always been aware of the violent booms and busts in arctic wildlife it was not until the English ecologist Charles  started to examine statistics on fur-bearing animals that these multiannual fluctuations were found to follow a cyclic pattern
Elton recognized that there were conspicuous peaks in the number of arctic fox skins exported from arctic Canada every 4 years and he found a similar cyclicity in the Norwegian zoologist Robert Colletts compilation of records on lemming years in Norway
Today the literature is considerably broader Many thousands of scientific papers on population cycles have been published in the 80 years after Eltons discovery
The phenomenon is not restricted to arctic species although it is definitely most common in northern areas
Moreover it is on the arctic tundra that population cycles seem to be most intertwined with the functioning of the whole ecosystem
The important ecosystem consequences of population cycles were highlighted three decades ago during the International Biological Program e
but in recent years this perspective has drawn less attention
The recent realization that climate change will affect arctic ecosystems severely and that altered cyclic dynamics in tundra species are likely to be involved  calls for a renewed focus on the role of such cycles in the Arctic

Dont GoGenerally categorized as Arctic or alpine tundra refers to a treeless biome that ranks among the coldest on Earth
Though covered in snow most of the year the tundra experiences a short summer growing season during which animal and plant activity peaks
Virtually no reptiles or amphibians can live in tundras harsh conditions but other tundra plants and animals have developed adaptations that allow them to survive in such a frigid environment
A number of mammals can survive in tundra habitats thanks to special adaptations and the insulation fur and fat provide
A prominent example is the herbivorous musk ox
One of the largest Arctic tundra mammals the musk ox has a dense coat which combined with its large size and short legs and tail reduces the loss of body heat
Other arctic tundra herbivores include arctic hares squirrels voles lemmings and caribou which have hooves that support them in snow
Arctic tundra carnivores include arctic foxes and polar bears
In alpine tundra marmots mountain goats pikas sheep and elk occur
Many birds that occur in Arctic tundra are migratory which means they only travel to such regions during the warmer summer period
These include ravens snow buntings falcons terns and several gull species
Others birds however such as ptarmigan and the lemming-eating snowy owl are year-round tundra residents
Ptarmigan are brown in summer but white in the winter
Male snowy owls are completely white which makes it difficult for predators to spot them against snow
Create the almost perfect bracket One insect species that has adapted well to frigid conditions is the tundra bumblebee which has dense hair that guards against heat loss
It can also use its flight muscles to generate heat through shiver-like movements
Mosquitoes flies and moths are also found in Arctic tundra regions while grasshoppers and butterflies occur in both Arctic and alpine tundra
Cod flatfish and salmon are a few of the fish found in tundra waters
Some tundra fish have special adaptations like the Alaska blackfish which produces a chemical that lowers the freezing point of the fluids in its cells
Many animals that live in tundra environment including fish grow and reproduce at slower rates
Unlike trout in other parts of the world for example tundra lake trout have been known to take up to 10 years to mature
According to the University of California Museum of Paleontology 1700 kinds of plants occur in Arctic tundra
Some of the adaptions that allow vegetation to grow in these regions include short roots and furry or wax-like coatings
The flowers of the woolly louse for example have dense hair that generate heat through a greenhouse-like effect
Other Arctic tundra plants include shrubs sedges reindeer mosses liverworts grasses and several species of lichen
Drainage is limited by permafrost in Arctic tundra but not so in alpine tundra where dwarf trees and small-leafed shrubs are plentiful

Dont GoTundra regions make up some of the coldest regions on Earth
The word tundra derives from the Finnish word for treeless plain which fits a broad description of the tundra biome
The tundra regions tend to range in a circuit from south of the Arctic ice caps
Tundra climates can be found in the high Arctic or at high elevations in mountains outside the Arctic
The climate of the tundra maintains a generally cold temperature range notable for its wind and its low precipitation
The tundra climate is a very dry and bitterly cold climate found chiefly in the Arctic regions or at high alpine locations
The tundra climate offers a brief growing season that encourages low species diversity
The animals and plants of the tundra biome have adapted to survive the harsh climate
The Arctic tundra temperature ranges from 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit
Winter temperatures can reach -30 to -50 degrees Fahrenheit
Some areas such as Iceland experience slightly warmer temperatures due to their proximity to the Gulf Stream
Bitter tundra temperatures in winter last from six to 10 months leading to permanently frozen subsurface ground called permafrost
The region can experience a brief summer with cool to relatively warm tundra temperatures up to 50 degrees Fahrenheit
Despite its typically snowy appearance the tundra in fact receives very little precipitation
It exists essentially as a frigid desert
The average yearly precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches
Precipitation falls as snow in the winter months and in summer it exists as either rain or fog
The permafrost and bogs store water in the tundra
Create the almost perfect bracket Tundra climates can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere at high latitudes
Subregions delineate based on their latitude high Arctic tundra middle Arctic tundra and low Arctic tundra
The more extreme climate of the high Arctic tundra ensures a stark landscape peppered across islands with varied lichen and moss species
The middle Arctic tundra experiences a pattern of freezing and thawing with enough moisture to encourage sphagnum moss
The low Arctic tundra hosts many more plant species such as shrubs berries and smaller trees including evergreens and abuts boreal forest climates
Another area of tundra climate alpine tundra exists at high altitudes in the northern hemisphere
While the seasonal status of alpine tundra differs from the Arctic tundra regions alpine tundra climate nevertheless resembles the harshness of the far north
At high elevations trees become stunted in the cold with little soil
Heaths and forbs flourish in this environment
The alpine tundra areas exist above the tree line of mountains
Alpine tundra regions experience a much longer growing season than Arctic tundra regions due to their lower latitude
The tundra biome is considered the worlds coldest biome
The growing season of the tundra tends to range up to 60 days
In the high latitudes in summer the sun remains in the sky at every hour
Because of the short growing season few trees exist in the tundra
Dominant plant species include mosses lichens and shrubs
Vegetation in the northern limits of the tundra tends to be smaller and vegetation in the southern portion tends to be larger
The most extreme polar northern areas experience essentially no vegetation
The presences or absence of surface water encourages microclimates for plant life
Approximately 1700 plant species live within the Arctic and subarctic tundra
Soils offer low nutrients and the permafrost tends to contain mainly gravel
Flowers often face the sun this is a quality known as heliotropic to gain heat
Plants tend to rely upon wind for seed dispersal due to the prevalent tundra winds
In general the tundra biome lacks much species diversity
Animals and plants residing in the tundra climate require special adaptations in order to survive
Animals tend toward large stocky frames with thick insulation
Layers of fat and fur or feathers help protect animals from the bitter cold
Winter plumage and coats tends to be white like snow whereas summer coloring tends toward brown
Because of permafrost few burrowing animals reside in the tundra climate
The lack of winter food also discourages hibernation
Animals must therefore be active in winter or migrate
Birds tend to boast long wingspans
There are essentially no cold-blooded vertebrates due to the extreme cold temperatures but insects do subsist in the tundra ecosystem
Most insect species in the tundra tend to be aquatic
Plants adapt to the savage cold and harsh wind via low height and clumping together
The tundras few trees remain stunted as an adaptation to the protective insulation of snow on the ground
Plants also photosynthesize even in the low light and cold temperatures
While animal diversity trends lower in the tundra ecosystem notable permanent and migratory species exist
The lemming represents the chief herbivore of the tundra
The snowy owl reigns as a partially migratory predator that responds to lemming population fluctuations
Other Arctic tundra animals include the iconic polar bears Arctic foxes gray wolves voles Arctic hares squirrels and snow geese
Seals walrus and beluga whales ply the arctic waters
The tundra draws migratory animals such as caribou and waterfowl particularly for breeding seasons
When colder weather arrives these animals return south to avoid the harshest conditions
Migratory birds include sandpipers gulls loons ravens and terns among others
Tundra fish species include salmon trout and cod
Marmots sheep goats and many species of birds reside in alpine tundra regions
These alpine animals subsist on insects and plants in warmer areas
Typical insect species include bumblebees moths flies mosquitos and grasshoppers
Climate change rapidly alters the tundra
Animals adapted to the harsh climate must compete with animals moving north due to warmer temperatures
Rapid melting of permafrost in the Arctic threatens to accelerate climate change as well
Because permafrost stores a large percentage of carbon if released in the atmosphere due to melting it threatens to accelerate the greenhouse effect with additional carbon dioxide or methane
And as the permafrost melts new populations of animals will continue to shift into the region to consume the water and plants
Plants that could not thrive in the tundra climate can now grow changing the tundra ecosystem
Warmer Arctic temperatures mean that freezing occurs much later in the season
Additional challenges to the tundra climate include human encroachment for oil drilling and pollution
The tundra takes longer to recover from vast changes than many regions
These processes are occurring so quickly that the delicate tundra ecosystem may not survive
Scientists continue to learn from the tundra climate via studying its permafrost which preserves evidence of past climate fluctuations
As scientists learn more about how climate change affects the tundra climate conserving the tundra ecosystem can help ensure the protection of this intriguing biome

Dont GoThe tundra is an inhospitable land for human beings
Lacking trees it can seem like a strange and barren place
The weather in the tundra regions of the world actually resembles that of another region of the globe in one very important way
However stark the tundra appears at first glance and no matter how severe the weather it still supports life
There are two types of tundra as classified by science
One is the alpine tundra which can be found at any very high altitude on mountainsides
The other type of tundra is Arctic tundra which occurs in the far northern hemisphere and in parts of Antarctica
Both tundras share similar characteristics they are swept by windy cold weather and there is little plant life
However the alpine tundra lacks permafrost which is a trait of the Arctic tundra
Permafrost occurs when the soil is frozen up to 3 feet down
In the summer the Arctic tundra can achieve temperatures that are close to 50 degrees but it can still dip below freezing at night
The permafrost melts during the summer creating swamps bogs and lakes that breed insects by the millions
In the winter the tundra is a harsher place
It can be as cold as -50 degrees F and the average is a bone chilling -20 degrees F
Create the almost perfect bracket One of the unrelenting features of the tundra is the constant wind
Winds can reach 60 miles an hour and they are always present as there are no trees to break up the gusts
Another feature of the tundra is a lack of precipitation
The average rainfall annually in tundra regions is just 6 to 10 inches with most of that falling in the summer months
This means that the tundra has less rain than some of the deserts of the world
Depending on how close to the poles you are you will experience long days of sunlight in the summer and long nights in the winter months becasue of the angle of the sun
People think that nothing can grow on the tundra but this is not true
Despite the presence of the permafrost which makes it impossible for any large trees to put down roots that would support them many species of plants grow on the tundra
Short trees like dwarf willows are found on the tundra along with small birches no taller than a child
The predominant plants though are mosses and lichens
Animals such as the barren ground caribou the lemming the Arctic hare Arctic fox and the polar bear all call the tundra home
The Antarctic has regions where there is tundra including several of the islands that surround the frozen continent
Although the vast majority of Antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice there are areas where rocky soil can support lichens and mosses
Algae can grow on the tundra of Antarctica which actually supports two species of flowering plants

The  is located between the north pole and the coniferous forests or  region
It is characterized by extremely cold temperatures and land that remains frozen year-round
Arctic tundra occurs in frigid mountaintop regions at very high elevations
can be found in high elevations anywhere in the world even in tropic regions
Although the land is not frozen year-round as in arctic tundra regions these lands are typically covered in snow for most of the year
The arctic tundra is located in the extreme northern hemisphere around the
This area experiences low amounts of precipitation and extremely cold temperatures for most of the year
The arctic tundra typically receives less than 10 inches of precipitation per year mostly in the form of snow with temperatures averaging below minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit in winter
In summer the sun remains in the sky during the day and night
Summer temperatures average between 35-55 degrees Fahrenheit
The alpine tundra  is also a cold climate region with temperatures averaging below freezing at night
This area receives more precipitation throughout the year than the arctic tundra
The average annual precipitation is around 20 inches
Most of this precipitation is in the form of snow
The alpine tundra is also a very windy area
Strong winds blow at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour
Some locations of arctic and alpine tundra includeDue to dry conditions poor soil quality extremely cold temperatures and  vegetation in arctic tundra regions is limited
Arctic tundra plants must adapt to the cold dark conditions of the tundra as the sun does not rise during the winter months
These  experience brief periods of growth in the summer when temperatures are warm enough for vegetation to grow
The vegetation consists of short shrubs and grasses
The frozen ground prevents plants with deep roots like trees from growing
Tropical alpine tundra areas are treeless plains located on mountains at extremely high altitudes
Unlike in the arctic tundra the sun remains in the sky for about the same amount of time throughout the year
This enables the vegetation to grow at an almost constant rate
The vegetation consists of short shrubs grasses and rosette perennials
Examples of tundra vegetation include lichens mosses sedges perennial forbs rosette and dwarfed shrubs
Animals of the arctic and alpine  must adapt to cold and harsh conditions
Large  of the arctic like musk ox and caribou are heavily insulated against the cold and migrate to warmer areas in the winter
Smaller mammals like the arctic ground squirrel survive by burrowing and hibernating during the winter
Other arctic tundra animals include snowy owls reindeer polar bears white foxes lemmings arctic hares wolverines caribou migrating birds mosquitoes and black flies
Animals in the alpine tundra migrate to lower elevations in winter to escape the cold and find food
Animals here include marmots mountain goats bighorn sheep elk grizzly bears springtails beetles grasshoppers and butterflies

Tundra includes some of the most inhospitable regions in the world characterized by sub-zero temperatures and short growing seasons
The three geographically distinct regions are the Arctic tundra alpine tundra and the Antarctic tundra
Vegetation in these regions comprises of sedge moss lichen dwarf shrub and grass while larger trees may also grow in a scattered fashion

Dont GoThe tundra region derives its name from the Finnish word tunturia which means treeless plain
The tundra is characterized by a harsh frost-laden landscape minus-zero temperatures lack of precipitation nutrients and extremely short seasons
Divided into two major categories the artic tundra and alpine tundra the tundra environment is characterized by a distinct climate flora and fauna
The arctic tundra formed 10000 years ago and is the worlds youngest biome according to the Blue Planet Biomes web site
Situated around the North Pole the artic tundra extends south to the coniferous forests of the taiga
Areas known as wet tundra are found across the sub-arctic region and are comprised of permanently frozen subsoil around 2000 feet deep known as permafrost
Another portion of the tundra called the artic scrub consists of a river drainage area and sheltered valleys that serves as a biodiversity habitat
The alpine tundra is located atop tall and cold high-altitude mountains across the world
The soil in the alpine tundra is well-drained and devoid of nutrients making it impossible for trees to grown in these areas
Several parts of the alpine tundra are known as dry tundra
Create the almost perfect bracket The artic is renowned for its cold desert-like conditions
Winter and summer are its two main seasons with spring lasting for a short duration between winter and summer
Rainfall varies in different artic regions and yearly precipitation including melting snow is around 6 to 10 inches
Summer temperatures in the artic tundra range between 37 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures average around minus-29 degrees Fahrenheit
Characterized by low-nutrient soil with sparse vegetation the artic tundra is home ot around 1700 different species of shrubs sedges mosses lichens grasses and 400 varieties of flowers
Plants are adapted to sweeping winds and soil disturbances growing short and grouping together to resist the cold temperatures
The growing season lasts for around 50 to 60 days
With the exception of birch trees in the lower latitudes no other trees inhabit the artic tundra
Since the ground is always frozen beneath the soils top layer trees cannot send roots down
Willows grow in some tundra regions but only as low carpets around 3 inches high
Tundra animal life is restricted to the challenging environment and reptiles and amphibians do not exist in this habitat
According to the Physical Geography web site the caribou musk ox arctic hare voles and lemmings are the principal herbivores which enable a few carnivores like the arctic fox snow owl polar bear and wolf to survive

Dont GoEcosystems in the tundra biome feature plants and animals adapted to life in a cold dry climate
The word tundra is descriptive of the landscape in this biome and means treeless plain
Biomes are regions with a particular climate where a community of organisms coexist
At first glance this biome may appear lifeless but it supports a diversity of plants mammals birds fish and other organisms
Living things within an ecosystem interact to transfer energy when they eat or are eaten by other organisms
Food chains show how energy transfers from one living thing to another
Like most biomes climate plays a large role in determining the types of organisms that live in an ecosystem
The climate in the tundra biome is cold dry and windy
Temperatures rise above freezing during summer but the landscape is nearly always covered with frost snow or ice
Summer temperatures peak around 50 degrees Fahrenheit and in winter drop to nearly -30 degrees F
The top layer of soil is frozen year-round a condition called permafrost
About 20 percent of Earth is tundra
Tundra ecosystems are found mainly in North America Europe Asia and coastal Antarctica
There are three types of tundra alpine Arctic and Antarctic
Alpine tundra is in mountainous regions at high elevations
It is the only type of tundra biome that does not have permafrost and it supports a wider variety of plant life
Arctic and Antarctic tundra are located near to the poles and are colder than alpine biomes
Create the almost perfect bracket A food chain has organisms that producers and organisms that are consumers
Consumers are obtain food by eating other living things
Producers like plants and algae make their own food
A food chain shows the flow of energy in an ecosystem
Energy from the sun allows producers to make their own food
Primary consumers eat producers and secondary consumers eat primary consumers
Secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers who are the top of the food chain
Energy is lost at each trophic level of a food chain
As a result there are fewer organisms per level moving up the food chain
There are more producers than consumers and there are fewer organisms who are tertiary consumers than any other trophic level
Cold temperatures permafrost and poor soil quality limit the number of producers in tundra ecosystems
Plants are mainly short grasses low-growing shrubs mosses and liverworts
Flowering plants live mainly in alpine tundra biomes
Trees cannot grow here due to the cold dry climate
Squirrels lemmings hares reindeer and caribou are primary consumers that feed on plants
Arctic foxes grizzly bears wolves and falcons are some of the animals that prey on the primary consumers
Arctic tundra ecosystems also include marine life such as polar bears seals salmon gulls and terns
Antarctic tundra support only a few plant species and there are no land mammals
Ecosystems are centered mainly on marine-based food chains that include algae plankton krill fish penguins seals and whales
Alpine and some Arctic biome food chains are based on terrestrial plants and animals
Plants are the producers and primary consumers include rodents hares and caribou
These primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers such as foxes wolves and bears
In coastal areas tertiary consumers such as bears feed on fish which are secondary consumers that feed on smaller fish
Marine food chains in the Arctic and Antarctic regions have more tertiary consumers than land-based food chains
These tundra consumers such as seals and whales feed on animals that eat other consumers
For example a fish eats algae and is eaten by a penguin which is eaten by a seal
Algae is a producer the fish is a primary consumer the penguin is a secondary consumer and the seal is a tertiary consumer
Living things in a biome dont interact solely within the confines of a single food chain
Tundra food chains only show the flow of energy from one species to the next
Multiple food chains intersect to form a food web which shows how energy is transferred between multiple species
Food webs are more complex because they show how energy transfers between animals in different food chains
Multiple primary consumers feeding on different producers become prey for more than one type of secondary consumer which in turn may be eaten by more than one type of tertiary consumer
For example a food chain with wolves as secondary consumers that prey on hares can intersect with a food chain in which falcons are the secondary consumer preying on hares

Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except
Grasslands are found in most  of the
For example there are five  classifications subdivisions of the    which is one of eight  of the Earths surface
Dont GoA grassland consists of large rolling fields of grasses flowers and herbs
Grasslands ecosystems emerge due to low levels of sporadic precipitation that is only substantial enough to support smaller plants
Grass survives in these arid conditions because of its deep and highly elaborate root system that enables it to access moisture hidden deep in the soil
There are two main types of grasslands -- tropical and temperate -- with several subcategories within each type
Tropical grasslands are warm all year round with established rainy and dry seasons
During the rainy season tropical grasslands receive between 50 and 130 centimeters of rain
Most notable of the tropical grasslands is the African savanna which has an occasional tree and is home to many of the worlds most spectacular species such as elephants giraffes lions and zebras
Savanna grass is usually quite short making for excellent grazing and hunting grounds
Temperate grasslands also have two seasons growing and dormant
During the dormant season no grass or crops grow because its too cold
These grasslands make for excellent farming because of their deep and nutrient-rich soils
Temperate grasslands receive between 25 and 75 centimeters of rain a year
The most notable temperate grasslands are the North American prairies which are home to a wide variety of wildlife including pronghorn antelope mice jack rabbits foxes snakes and coyotes
Grass here can grow quite tall reaching up to seven meters in height
Trees are restricted to where there is a large concentration of water such as a river or lake
Because of their deep rich soil more than half of temperate prairie grasslands have been converted to farmland that provides a large chunk of the worlds food
Create the almost perfect bracket Its important to remember that grass can thrive in wide range of climates
In fact grasslands make up over a quarter of the Earths land
Other notable grassland ecosystems are flooded grasslands polar or tundra grasslands montane grasslands and xeric or desert grasslands
Flood grasslands are flooded seasonally or year round
These grasslands occur mostly in subtropical and tropical climates
The most notable flood grassland is Floridas Everglades
Polar or tundra grasslands occur in high to subarctic regions
These grasslands consist mainly of shrubs and have a very short growing season
Montane grasslands are high-altitude grasslands located on high mountain ranges and valleys
A notable example of montane grasslands is the paramo of the Andes
Xeric or desert grasslands are very sparse grasslands located in and on the outskirts of deserts
Grass here is highly resistant to disease and drought

There are thousands of species of plants in the Arctic tundra
The plants tend to be small and close to the ground
This protects them from strong winds and cold temperatures
Some plants that grow in the tundra include lichen short shrubs sedges grasses flowers birch trees and willow trees
which also grow in the tundra are types of plants that grow low to the ground in tight places
They are called cushion plants because they are soft and cushiony

Dont GoGrassland biomes are found all over the world in various forms
Often called plains prairies or steppes grasslands are any large land area with enough rainfall to support grass growth but not enough to sustain trees and other shrubbery
Grasslands are often considered a transitional biome between deserts and forests
Grassland biomes are found on every continent except Antarctica
In North America grasslands are called prairies and are found across the Midwestern United States and Canada
In South America grasslands are known as pampas and have moist humid climates
The steppes of Russia dominate Eurasia from the Ukraine to Siberia
Most of Africas grasslands are actually classified as savannas because they feature scattered individual trees but the veldt of South Africa is a true grassland
There are three main types of grasslands identified by the dominant grassland plants
The first is tall grasslands which are sometimes referred to as temperate grasslands
They have grasses as high as five feet tall and receive upwards of 30 inches of annual rainfall
The American prairies are examples of temperate grasslands
At the other end of the spectrum are short grasslands or steppes
Like their name indicates they have short grass and very little rainfall typically less than 10 inches a year
Any less water and theyd be desert
The steppes of Russia are short grasslands
Mixed grasslands exist between the two extremes
Their grasses grow about two or three feet high and receive an average of 15 to 25 inches of rainfall per year
Create the almost perfect bracket The exact features of each grassland biome depend entirely on their climates and locations
The one constant is the presence of grass as opposed to trees which cant survive due to the limited water supply and high winds that whip across the flat unobstructed terrains
Temperate grasslands receive most of their rainfall in the spring and summer
Their temperatures have a wide range from 100 degrees F in the summer to as low as -40 degrees F in the winter
Even in the summer temperatures can dip dramatically at night
Temperate grasslands have dark rich soil gaining nutrients from the many layers of growing and decaying grass roots
This makes them the perfect environment for wild grasses like blue grama buffalo grass and galleta not to mention flowers such as asters goldenrods sunflowers clovers and wild indigo
Animals found in temperate grasslands include badgers deer foxes hawks jack rabbits mice owls prairie dogs and snakes
Small animals do best in grasslands since they dont need much cover to hide
However plenty of large animals call grasslands home including bison elephants giraffes and zebras
The term biome simply means any large community of plants and animals occupying a distinct region
Grass is the defining feature in the grassland biome
Grasslands are becoming rare
They are often converted for agricultural uses in order to take advantage of their rich soils
Global warming is also posing a threat with rising temperatures turning many grassland biomes into deserts

Of all the different biomes on  it is the temperate grasslands that you are most likely to encounter on a regular basis or might affect your life
While there are larger biomes such as the aquatic one the temperate grasslands are most closely involved with sustaining human life
By the end of this article you will be able to answer the following questions
Dont GoTemperate grasslands have significant variations in temperatures with hot summers and cold winters
Precipitation is moderate with just enough rain and snow to distinguish these areas from deserts
Because grasslands have few if any trees strong winds often blow through them adding to the dryness
Temperate grasslands are found in the prairies and plains of central North America in the South African veldts Hungarys pusztas the steppes of Russia and the pampas of Uruguay and Argentina
The prairie grassland average temperature often rises to more than 100 degrees F and periods of up to two months with no rain at all are common
Grassland plants are adapted to hot summer temperatures and drought with their slender leaves that help them retain water and deep root systems
Summers heat and dryness often results in fires caused by lightning or human activity
Grasses with their deep roots grow back after a fire even more vigorously with the help of the carbonized organic matter
Grasslands turn brown in winter and often have a dusting of snow
Temperatures plummet well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit
For example temperatures in the grassland areas near Winnipeg in Canada can dip to -10 degrees F and average -4 degrees F
Plants use winter snow as insulation trapping it among leaves and stems
Create the almost perfect bracket Grasslands are found in the interior of continents and in rain shadows regions of lower rainfall on the lee side of a mountain
These areas receive between 9
8 and 35 inches of rain and snow each year compared with tropical rain forests with more than 79 inches and deserts with less than 9
8 inches of precipitation
Most of the grassland precipitation falls in winter and spring
Grassland animals and plants contend with drought in the hot summers
The amounts of rain and snow vary in the grassland biome
Southern temperate grasslands are nearer to the ocean than the prairies they experience more rainfall more evenly spread throughout the year
With up to 35 inches of annual rainfall grasses grow taller
A few trees such as cottonwoods oaks and willows can be found growing on riverbanks
In the less humid zones of the steppes and prairies which are further from the ocean the 12 to 20 inches of precipitation falls mainly in winter and spring
The grasses in these areas are shorter and sparse
Some unique grassland areas can have as much as 79 inches of rainfall when other factors such as minerals in the soil prevent most plants from growing

Dont GoTemperate grasslands are found in several locations on the Earth
They are characterized by the abundance of grasses and the absence of trees and shrubs
The temperature and climate are moderate as indicated by the temperate designation
The amount of precipitation varies from one location to another affecting the height of the grasses
Occasional drought conditions lead to fires which affect the climate and makeup of the grasslands
Temperate grasslands are found in North America in the prairies and great plains of the United States and Canada
Most of these grasslands have been converted to agricultural uses
The desert grasslands of the southwestern United States are considered temperate grasslands as are some grasslands in California
In Asia the grasslands are known as steppes stretching from the Ukraine to the eastern parts of Russia
The puszta in Hungary and the South America grasslands in Argentina and Uruguay known as the pampas are both temperate grasslands
In South Africa temperate grasslands are known as the veld or veldt
The temperature in temperate grasslands varies greatly depending upon the time of the year
In general summers are hot and winters are cold
According to the University of California Museum of Paleontology the temperature in the summer can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit
In winter the temperature can drop to 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit
Create the almost perfect bracket Rainfall in the temperate grasslands of the world falls into the moderate category
The average is 20 to 25 inches per year occurring mostly in late spring and early summer
An exception are the regions known as steppes where rainfall can range from 10 to 20 inches per year
The lack of rain produces a dryer climate with shorter grasses
In the United States the precipitation can take the form of snow with occasional blizzards in the great plains and prairies
Due to the fact that the precipitation may be concentrated in one part of the year the climate is subject to periodic drought
Strong winds blow across the temperate grasslands
Without trees or other wind breaks the prairies and great plains in the United States experience conditions that can disrupt and displace the soil
Farmers must take measures to ensure that dust bowl conditions do not exist
When combined with drought conditions the windy and dry climate presents a challenging climate for the farmers and their crops

Major Grasslands of the WorldIn North America they are mostly called prairies
In South America they are known as pampas
Europe and Asia mostly have steppes
In Africa they are known as savannas and in Australia people often know them as rangelands
In the Northern hemisphere they are sometimes also known as tundras and in the Southern hemisphere as desert grasslands
In mountain regions they are called montane grasslands and in flooded regions as flooded grasslands

They greatly vary in flora fauna and climate but are always exposed to a certain amount of rainfall and are full of various fascinating forms of life
Grasslands can be found almost everywhere in the world and are known by various names depending on the region and climate in which they are located
But the problem is that humankind is gradually but persistently destroying these wonderful natural habitats transforming them into farmland due to their fertile soil

Dont GoWhether its a wet tall-grass prairie in the American Midwest or a tropical savanna of widely spaced trees grassland ecosystems come in many forms but are everywhere dominated by grasses and forbs instead of woody vegetation
Climate -- and the day-to-day weather conditions that define it over time -- is a pre-eminent criterion for grassland development These are landscapes frequently defined by drought and fire
Climate -- which represents the average long-term weather patterns of a given region -- is a more useful environmental variable to consider than day-by-day weather
Geographers divide the world into six major climate types with numerous subtypes
The vastest expanses of grassland occur in tropical-savanna and midlatitude-steppe climate zones with smaller expanses in subtropical-steppe humid-continental subtropical-desert and midlatitude-desert realms
In general grasslands tend to thrive where they can dominate woody plants such as trees and shrubs
Grasses dense shallow root networks are well-adapted to fine-textured soils with some precipitation in the growing season and seasonal dry periods they persist in the face of wildfire drought and heavy grazing via root systems and generative shoots shielded by dead outer tissues
Most tropical grasslands experience between 500 and 1500 millimeters 20 and 60 inches of rain annually and year-round temperatures between 15 to 35 degrees Celsius 59 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit the climate of temperate steppe is typically more variable throughout the year
Many tropical grasslands experience major fluxes in rainfall during distinct wet and dry seasons largely due to the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone -- that rainy belt near the equator where the trade winds merge
Such fluxes are defining environmental factors spurring for example the great yearly migrations of ungulates on the Serengeti and the seasonal flooding of wet grasslands in major marshland complexes such as the Pantanal in central South America the Okavango Delta in Botswana and the Sudd in South Sudan
In the midlatitudes the steppes commonly endure a full four seasons which can be quite intense Because they are typically situated deep in the interior and often partly blockaded by mountain ranges these grasslands have a truly continental climate little moderated by marine influence
In places such as the northern Great Plains or the semi-desert steppe fringing Asias Gobi Desert this makes for bitterly cold winters and sweltering summers
Create the almost perfect bracket Drought is an omnipresent reality in most of the worlds grasslands periodic dry periods are after all partly what keep steppelands and savanna free of woody vegetation
Years of drought however can begin to fundamentally transform a grassland the line between steppe and true desert can be a fine one
Wildfire is one of the foremost managers of these ecosystems essential in many areas for periodically clearing away invading tree and shrub saplings
While lightning is the leading natural source of such conflagrations ecologists suspect many grasslands such as those of western Oregons Willamette Valley were historically partly maintained by indigenous people who set them aflame to preserve openness and attract grazing animals with new growth
In the absence of such fires Willamette Valley prairies like those in similar situations worldwide are crowding in with trees the ecosystem climatically reverts to forest
The vast expanse of the midlatitude steppe provides a good breeding ground for storms
On the Great Plains and Central Lowlands of North America cold air swept off the Rocky Mountains and draining in from the north clash with warm moist Gulf of Mexico systems creating the ideal nursery for strong thunderstorms and to a degree found nowhere else on Earth the gigantic whirlwinds called tornadoes
In winter blizzards -- driven by extratropical cyclones sweeping from the lee of the Rockies -- commonly assault the Great Plains while the fast-moving cold fronts called Blue Northers can bring about startlingly abrupt even dangerous plunges in temperature under fair skies

Grasslands are environments in which grasses and grasslike plants dominate the vegetation
Grasslands once covered up to 25 to 40 percent of the earths land surface but many of these grasslands have been plowed for crop production
Prior to the European settlement of North America the largest grasslands in the United States stretched across the Great Plains from the Rocky Mountains and deserts of the southwestern states to the Mississippi River
Other extensive grasslands are or were found in Europe South America Asia and Africa

Animals that live in temperate grasslands must adjust to dry terrain in which just 10 to 30 inches of rain falls per year making temperate grasslands less diverse than the wetter savanna grasslands
Temperate grasslands are characterized by short grasses measuring just a few inches in height
The grasses upon which many animals in the grassland biome rely for food thrives during the warm growing season going dormant during the cold winter

Dont GoDifferent types of grasslands share similar characteristics
Savannas have scattered trees and predominate in certain parts of Africa South America Australia and Asia
Temperate grasslands are largely devoid of trees receive less rainfall than savannas and endure broader temperature extremes
The two types of temperate grasslands are steppes and prairies
Steppes have shorter grasses and prairies have taller grasses due to higher precipitation
You can find both types of temperate grasslands throughout North America and Europe
Read on to learn more about grasslands
Grasslands make up 25 percent of the Earths land surface and dominate in regions with limited rainfall which prevents forest growth
This is the result of nearby mountain ranges that cause rain shadows over adjacent open range lands
Typically grasslands have not only limited but also unpredictable rainfall and droughts are common
Where rainfall is even less deserts will form
Savannas on average receive roughly 76 to 101 centimeters 30 to 40 inches of rain per year but steppes only average 25 to 51 centimeters 10 to 20 inches per year
Prairies tend to be intermediate between savannas and steppes with 51 to 89 centimeters 20 to 35 inches per year
Temperatures vary much more in temperate grasslands than they do in savannas
Savannas are in warm climates with average annual temperatures that only vary between 21 and 26 degrees Celsius 70 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit
They typically have only two seasons a wet and a dry season
Temperate grasslands have hot summers where temperature can exceed 38 degrees Celsius 100 degrees Fahrenheit and cold winters that can drop below negative 40 degrees Celsius negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit
Create the almost perfect bracket Fires are an important grassland characteristic
Regular fires promote the growth of native grasses but limit the growth of trees
Native grasses have deeper root systems that can survive fires but invasive plants tend to have shallower roots and succumb to fires
Development has curtailed the number and extent of grassland fires and the lack of seasonal fires threatens the health of the worlds grasslands
Only 5 percent of the worlds grasslands are being protected and maintained and they remain the most endangered biome in the world
Savannas are home to some of the largest mammals on the planet such as elephants giraffes rhinos lions and zebras
Temperate grasslands are also home to large mammals particularly bison and horses medium-sized mammals like deer antelope and coyotes as well as small mammals such as mice and jack rabbits
The type of grasses that grow depend upon the amount of rainfall
Shorter steppe grasses often consist of buffalo grass and savanna grasses will contain taller grasses like bluestem and rye

United States Department of AgricultureThe Forest Service currently administers twenty National Grasslands consisting of 3
8 million acres of public land
These grasslands are managed for a variety of purposes including forage fish and wildlife timber water and recreation resources
While National Grasslands are valued for these basic goods they also deliver other important services that are often perceived to be free and limitless
Taken for granted as public benefits ecosystem services lack a formal market and are traditionally absent from societys balance sheet
As a result their critical contributions are overlooked in public corporate and individual decision-making

As you begin to learn about the  and all the life on it discovering all the different biomes can reveal just how everything fits together like a puzzle of life
A biome is a community of  that has a specific boundary created by climate and geography
There are all kinds of biomes from aquatic to terrestrial
In this article we are looking at grassland biomes
Grassland biomes are known by several other names
Dont GoA biome is a biological community of the earth classified according to the predominant vegetation and characterized by adaptations of organisms to that particular environment
Grassland biomes cover one-fifth of the worlds land
Although grass is the dominant vegetation in these biomes these communities also include other plants
A wide diversity of animal species is found in these grasslands as well
Grasslands are distributed across all the continents of the world except Antarctica
The grasslands in North America are called prairies
In Europe and Asia they are called steppes and in South America they are the pampas
Grasslands in Africa are called veldts and savannas--together they cover almost half of the continent
Grassland biomes are found in temperate and tropical climates
The grasslands are usually dry regions where the annual precipitation is 10 to 30 inches 25 to 76 centimeters
The temperature varies according to the location of the grassland
Temperature in the prairies can be as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer
The savanna grasslands in Africa experience milder temperatures
The average monthly temperature in this region is 64 degrees Fahrenheit
Create the almost perfect bracket Savannas or tropical grasslands consist mainly of grass
Few trees and shrubs also grow here
Temperate grasslands have similar vegetation
However trees here grow in smaller number
The prairies are home to different kinds of grasses such as tallgrass prairie porcupine grass and little bluestem
The grasses have adapted themselves to survive the grassland environment
Some plants especially wildflowers also grow in these grasslands
Trees such as box elder oaks and red bud trees are found in the North American prairies
Palms pines and acacias may grow sparsely in the tropical grasslands
A great variety of animals live in the grasslands
The African savannas have zebras gazelles elephants giraffes lions cheetahs hyenas and jackals
Bison pronghorn antelope and elk graze in the prairie grasses
Many bird species such as grasshopper sparrows also thrive here
The Eurasian steppes are home to grass-eating rodents coyotes foxes birds and reptiles
The pampas are home to geoffrey cats and viscachas
The existence of plants and animals in grasslands are being threatened by human activities such as grazing and farming
As a result they are being classified as engendered species such as kangaroo grass blue-tongue lizard and the Mexican prairie dog
Conservation efforts can help in the preventing the grasslands from further destruction

Dont GoCovering less than 2 percent of the planet rainforests are home to more than 50 percent of all plants and animals on the Earth
Rainforests in Central America are warm and wet environments with thick dense vegetation
These densely-packed plants and trees generate a large portion of the Earths oxygen
Many plants discovered in the Central American jungle are also used to develop new drugs to fight illness and disease
The diverse types of animals in the dense rain forest in Latin America range from insects and worms to large birds and mammals
The Central American rainforests are located in the tropical regions of the Earth which means they get plenty of sunlight year-round
The energy from the sun remains stored in the thick and dense plant life of the rainforest
Many different species of animals eat the plants which store that energy from the sun and thrive
This may explain why there are so many different animals living in the rainforest
A large number of medicines insecticides and other chemical compounds are derived from rainforest animals and plants
Spices like vanilla cloves and ginger also grow in the rainforest
Bugs and insects thrive in the warm and wet climate of the tropical rainforest
The scistosoma serves as one example of an invertebrate or parasitic trematode which makes its home in the bodies of several species of birds and snails
One blood-sucking insect the kissing bug bite into the lips or other exposed sensitive flesh of sleeping humans
Numerous species of spiders mosquitoes
Home to more organisms than all other biomes on the planet thousands of species have come to the rainforest and have adapted over time
Create the almost perfect bracket There are many species of mammals and birds found in the rainforests of Central America
Squirrel monkeys are very common in the rainforests of Central America and spend most of their lives in the upper tree canopy
Jaguars an endangered species are big cats that live in the rainforest
Jaguars along with many other animals and plants found in the rainforest are threatened by human encroachment shrinking habitat and hunting
Many rainforest birds like the Harpy eagle toucans cockatoos and some species of parrots are also threatened by habitat loss on over-hunting
The sheer number of different animal species which inhabit the Central American rainforest remains unknown
There are about 116 different species of poison dart frogs which are used by the natives to coat the tips of their poison darts for hunting
Iguanas one of the most common of all lizard pets also thrive in the rainforests of Central America
Most of the reptiles and lizards found here consume the many types of fresh fruits and vegetables found in the rainforest
Many different species of snake including boa constrictors and various sub-species of anaconda also make their home in the Central American rain forest

Grassland Ecosystem- As the name implies grasslands are open spaces in which a variety of grasses grow with only a few trees scattered near rivers and streams
The amount of annual rainfall influences the type of vegetation not enough to support a forest but enough to prevent it from becoming a desert
Grasslands are found on every continent except Antarctica
Grasslands are known in different regions of the world by different names prairies pampas steppes and savannah among others
They are divided into two types Tropical and Temperate

Dont GoBoth equatorial and midlatitude regions contain rainforests and rainforest weather and climate vary by geography
The two primary types of rainforests are tropical and temperate
A third type the tropical monsoon forest resembles the tropical rainforest except for the timing of precipitation
In tropical and temperate rainforests weather patterns follow two primary seasons wet and dry
Temperate rainforests have a long wet season and a short dry season
Rain still falls during the dry season however but not at the same rate as during the wet season
Much of the dry season precipitation in temperate rainforests comes in the form of fog
The wet and dry seasons in tropical rainforests are more equal
For example each season is about six months long in the Amazon basin and the wet season lasts from December to May
Tropical rainforests are located north and south of the equator between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
As such they have a warm and humid climate with lots of rainfall
Annual precipitation amounts vary greatly from 200 to 1020 centimeters 80 to 400 inches
In the Amazon rainforest precipitation can be more than 365 centimeters 12 feet in a year
Mean temperatures are above 18 degrees Celsius 64 degrees Fahrenheit
The weather will vary during the dry season as rainfall decreases
Create the almost perfect bracket Temperate rainforests are located in regions such as the northwest portion of the United States called the Pacific Northwest
Over two-thirds of all temperate rainforests are found in the Pacific Northwest
Mountain ranges protect temperate rainforests from weather extremes and they typically have moderate weather even though theyre located far from the equator
On average temperate rainforests will receive less rainfall and have cooler temperatures than their tropical counterparts
Precipitation averages approximately 250 centimeters 100 inches annually
But it will vary from 150 to 500 centimeters 60 to 200 inches in any given year
Tropical monsoon forests have a climate similar to tropical rainforests except for rainfall patterns
Monsoon climates are located along coastal areas which have different air circulation patterns than those seen in a typical tropical rainforest
Temperatures are comparable between the two and warm air dominates year-round
The amount of average annual precipitation is also similar between tropical monsoon forests and tropical rainforests
Monsoon forests however receive most of their precipitation during the peak of summer or the monsoon season due to changes in atmospheric circulation

Follow usTropical rainforests are the most diverse ecosystem on Earth and also the oldest
Today tropical rainforests cover only 6 percent of the Earths ground surface but they are home to over half of the planets plant and animal species
In this completely unique world there are thousands of species we have yet to discover
Copyright 2019  a division of  a Newsletter
Rain forests play an invaluable role in sustaining life but every year large portions of them are cut down for logging mining and cattle ranches
Found in the tropical climate near the equator rain forests make up six percent of the earths land surface but produce 40 percent of its oxygen
The rain forest is made up of four layers emergent upper canopy understory and forest floor
Emergent trees grow far apart and tall their branches reaching above the canopy
The upper canopy houses most of the rain forests animal species and forms a roof that blocks most light from reaching below it
The understory usually shaded and home to bushes and shrubs as well as the branches of canopy trees
The forest floor is in complete shade meaning there is little likelihood of plants growing there and making it easy to walk through the forest
Recently  has reduced the amount of rain forest present around the globe
In Brazil which houses about a third of the remaining  on Earth more than  were lost to deforestation since 1970 when only 2
4 percent of the rain forests there had been cleared
Biologists worry about the long-term consequences
Drought may be one
Some rain forests including the Amazon began experiencing drought in the 1990s possibly due to deforestation and global warming
Efforts to discourage deforestation mainly through sustainable-logging initiatives are underway on a very limited basis but have had a negligible impact so far
The rain forest is nearly self-watering
Plants release water into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration
In the tropics each canopy tree can release about 200 gallons 760 liters of water each year
The moisture helps create the thick cloud cover that hangs over most rain forests
Even when not raining these clouds keep the rain forest humid and warm
The environment of rain forests is ideal for plants An estimated two-thirds of the worlds plant species grow in the rain forest
Plants in the rain forest grow very close together and contend with the constant  of insect predators
They have adapted by making chemicals that researchers have found useful as medicines
Bioprospecting or going into the rain forest in search of plants that can be used in foods cosmetics and medicines has become big business during the past decade and the amount that native communities are compensated for this varies from almost nothing to a share in later profits
The  estimates that 70 percent of the anti-cancer plants identified so far are rain forest plants
A new drug under development by a private pharmaceutical company possibly for treating HIV is Calanolide A which is derived from a tree discovered on Borneo according to NCI
Many trees and plants like orchids have been removed from the rain forest and cultivated
Brazil nut trees are one valuable tree that refuses to grow anywhere but in undisturbed sections of the Amazon rain forest
There it is pollinated by bees that also visit orchids and its seeds are spread by the agouti a small tree mammal

Not all tropical forests are rainforests
Differences in soil composition altitude or rainfall allow for a number of forest types
Yet they all share one thing in common threat of deforestation
The term primary rainforest refers to untouched pristine forest that exists in its original condition i
its  development has not been perceptibly influenced by man
Everything else is secondary rainforest which has been disturbed in some way naturally or unnaturally

Posted by    Tropical rainforest biomes are found in the lower latitudes
The temperature is generally around 80 degrees
There is very high humidity too from 77 to 88
There isnt a big change in seasons like there are with many other biomes
Instead this is what you can expect day after day
It will rain just about every day due to the high humidity
That humidity mixes with the heat to create cumulus clouds
For millions of years it has been this way in this particular biome

Dont GoWith warm temperatures water and an abundance of food tropical rain forests support thousands of wildlife species
The competition means organisms must adapt or develop specialized traits to compete for environmental resources
Many rain forest animals use adaptations to carve out their own niches and protect themselves from predators
Being invisible to a predator or to prey is an advantage in the tropical rain forest
One animal the sloth combines expert cover with slow-motion movement to dodge predators such as the jaguar
A sloths fur is covered with green algae so it blends with the environment
It is the worlds slowest moving animal and takes up to a month to digest its food so it doesnt need many resources to survive
The boa constrictor uses its camouflaged invisibility to sneak up on prey while tiny rain forest grasshoppers have developed near-transparent coloring to blend in with leaves
The ground floor and lower canopies of the rain forest bustle with wildlife
The aptly named spider monkeys have adapted to live at the top of the tree canopy where they have little competition for food
The spider monkeys prehensile tail gives it the ability to swing gracefully from tree to tree
Sloths also live in the trees preferring to spend the day hanging upside down from branches
Their propensity for slow movement attests to the lack of predators they face
Create the almost perfect bracket Some animals in the rain forest have adapted to a limited diet so they dont face competition for food
Toucans snag hard-to-reach fruit inaccessible to other feathered flyers with their long narrow beaks
Parrots have incredibly sturdy bills to crack nuts and dig out hidden food
Leaf cutter ants put in a hard days work for a meal
They carry bits of leaves 50 times their weight from high branches to the ground
They bury the leaves and eat the fungus that grows as the plant matter decomposes
Rain forest animals and insects often use bright coloring and distinctive markings to scare predators
Some of these creatures such as certain species os poison dart frogs actually are dangerous but some arent
They merely assume the appearances of dangerous animals
For example some species of dart frogs arent poisonous at all they adapted to mimic their relatives poisonous nature
Another example is the completely benign lobster moth whose larva looks like a scorpion
Moths arent dangerous but many have markings on the wings that resemble eyes and those are usually enough to keep them safe
Large animals like lions and elephants live on the plains for good reason
Size is no advantage in the rain forest where a dense understory makes movement difficult
Jaguars are the largest cats in the rainforest but they seldom grow to more than six feet in length and weigh more than 200 pounds
The small size and stocky build give them the speed and strength they need to hunt small prey that live in trees
Snakes on the other hand can grow larger in the rainforest than elsewhere because of their ability to slither along the ground and through trees
Reaching lengths of 20 to 30 feet and weights of over 500 pounds anacondas are the worlds largest snakes
When the sun goes down some animals bed down
Others including the flying fox bat the leopard cat and Wallaces flying frog are bright-eyed and on the lookout for a meal
The adaptation to night hunting gives nocturnal animals the benefit of reduced competition for food
At night there are no birds to compete for the fruit and blossoms that form the diet for flying fox bats or the insects that flying frogs prefer
Leopard cats eat lizards insects amphibians and other small animals including flying foxes and flying frogs if they can catch them
Many of the animals that form the diet for these 10-pound feline predators are also active at night

Tropical forests take in and store more carbon than any other biome in the world but increasing temperatures may pose a threat to this invaluable service
This research aims to explore how temperature affects key tropical forest functions such as plant photosynthesis and soil respiration
To do this the Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment TRACE project will use infrared heating to warm the soil and plants of the understory as well as warming individual leaves and branches in the forest canopy
Within TRACE scientists are working together to measure the potential impacts of increasing temperatures on tropical forest productivity carbon cycling plant physiology and soil fertility
The ultimate goal of the work is to improve our understanding of how tropical forests will respond to altered temperatures and to determine how their response could be important at local regional and global scales
This integrated experiment is the first of its kind in any tropical forest and we expect to learn important truths about the fundamental relationships between temperature and how tropical forests work
Below are publications associated with this project
Atmospheric mass balance analyses suggest that terrestrial carbon C storage is increasing partially abating the atmospheric CO2 growth rate although the continued strength of this important ecosystem service remains uncertain
Some evidence suggests that these increases will persist owing to positive responses of vegetation growth net
Myriad field laboratory and modeling studies show that nutrient availability plays a fundamental role in regulating CO2 exchange between the Earths biosphere and atmosphere and in determining how carbon pools and fluxes respond to climatic change
Accordingly global models that incorporate coupled climatecarbon cycle feedbacks made a
Although tropical forests account for only a fraction of the planets terrestrial surface they exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other biome on Earth and thus play a disproportionate role in the global climate
In the next 20 years the tropics will experience unprecedented warming yet there is exceedingly high
Tropical forests play a major role in regulating global carbon C fluxes and stocks and even small changes to C cycling in this productive biome could dramatically affect atmospheric carbon dioxide CO2 concentrations
Temperature is expected to increase over all land surfaces in the future yet we have a surprisingly poor understanding of how

Dont GoThe Amazon Rainforest creates 20 percent of the Earths oxygen because of its abundant tree and plant life
While the worlds tropical rainforests vary -- from Africa Southeast Asia and South and Central America -- they all share key attributes high precipitation levels and temperatures poor soil quality and a startling array of biodiversity
Human intervention like forestry agriculture and mineral extraction continues to harm these valuable ecosystems to this day
The Earth is home to three main rainforests found in Africa Central and South America and Southeast Asia
These rainforests share similar characteristics lots of rain high humidity and temperatures poor soil quality and abundant biodiversity
While the exact amount of rainfall rainforests see varies from year to year and location to location they all receive copious amounts of rain
South Americas rainforests can see from 6 12 to 10 feet of rainfall in a single year
That said deforestation for use as farmland can decrease annual precipitation amounts
In the African rainforests cutting down rainforest trees can reduce rainfall their peers see by 50 percent
Tropical rainforests are also incredibly humid 88 percent humid in wet seasons and 77 percent in dry seasons
Earths three tropical rainforest systems sit between two latitudes called the Tropic of Cancer located at 2327N and the Tropic of Capricorn a 2327S hence the term tropic
As these regions either sit near to or in some cases directly on the equator -- the central latitude of the Earth that sees the most sunshine year-round -- they tend to be quite warm
The average temperature of a tropical rainforest is 85 degrees Fahrenheit
While on occasion temperatures can get much higher temperatures change very little 9 degrees between seasons due to the equators constant proximity to the sun
High humidity levels makes tropical rainforests feel even hotter
Create the almost perfect bracket Rainforests have thick canopies of leaves and provide homes for a staggering variety of species more than 45000 in the Amazon alone
Under normal circumstances this would mean more nutrients in the soil as members of the ecosystems biologically-rich makeup die and decompose in the dirt
But the heavy rainfall in these areas washes these nutrients away
Similarly the hot and moist conditions decompose dead animal and plant matter quickly causing existing plants to use up the nutrients faster than they would otherwise
Despite making up only 6 percent of the worlds landmass rainforests contain 50 percent of Earths land-based species biologists estimate
To put things in perspective the rainforests of Borneo house around 2500 distinct orchid species
The heavy rainfall and easy access to nutrients provide the setting for many thousands of plant species which in turn feed animals which feed other animals in a never-ending cycle
While each tropical rainforest shares common attributes many species can be found only in one area like the sharp-toothed meat-eating piranha fish native to rivers in the Amazon rainforest

The tropical rainforest is earths most complex biome in terms of both structure and species diversity
It occurs under optimal growing conditions abundant precipitation and year round warmth
There is no annual rhythm to the forest rather each species has evolved its own flowering and fruiting seasons
Sunlight is a major limiting factor
A variety of strategies have been successful in the struggle to reach light or to adapt to the low intensity of light beneath the canopy

Dont GoThe desert holds a place in the world as one of the most grueling terrains in existence
Although it can be a very void place there is no shortage of desert animals and plants they are simply better adapted to the environment
Animals and plants range from large camels that have been utilized for transportation for centuries to trees that have learned to survive on very little water
For desert plants and animals information is abundant even if water is scarce
The bilbyor the rabbit-eared bandicootof the deserts of Australia is considered to be an endangered species since they are preyed upon by animals and people alike
All species being nocturnal they go underground during the day and ferret food at night
Insects snails and mice as well as fruit and underground bulbs serve as food for these little marsupials
The dromedary more popularly known as the Arabian camel can be found in the Middle East Africa as well as India and Pakistan
Amazingly these single hump-backed animals store fats in their humpsmaking them go for 3 to 4 days with no water and food
Their diet includes grass dates oats and wheat
Create the almost perfect bracket First discovered in 1853 the desert iguana is mostly seen in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of Southern California
Just like the bilby this animal stays in burrows especially besides cactus plants
Although considered a vegetarian since its favorite meal is the flowers of the creosote bush it also feeds on smaller insects which include ants and beetles
Aptly named so because of the side winding action that it does when it crawls the sidewinder snake inhabits the deserts of Africa the Middle East and North America
Upon closer examination of the tracks they leave behind people notice that they resemble the letter J where the end of the letter shows the direction the snake is heading
The desert tortoise is able to adapt to the extreme temperature of the desert through its large urinary bladder
Whenever it finds water it works like a sponge storing enough water to equal over 40 percent of its body weight
Because of this amazing ability it can go without water for months
Adults are known to go without water for nearly one year
Major food sources include fruits herbs and wildflowers
The Creosote bush has been able to adapt to the intense heat of the Mojave desert through altering its physical structure making it a xerophyte
Having green leaves which prevents water loss through its resin coating and yellow flowers this plant has a distinctly pleasantly smelling odor
This shrub commonly found in the Mojave and Sonoran desert survives by drawing water through its extremely long roots--growing as long as 80 feet
This phreatophyte plant is also well-known for its sweetness
It typically is made into a syrup and tea

Deserts are hot dry places made up mostly of sand rock and mountains
In general deserts are defined as areas where more water evaporates in the air than falls to the ground as rain
The  consists of a myriad of charming places
Its also home to numerous plant and animal species including humans
This entire species live in completely distinct environments
These distinct environments are known as
Some of the main biomes of the world include grassland biome  deciduous forest biome taiga biome and rainforest biome and aquatic biomes
Of all the biomes existing on planet earth rainforest biome is home to the most  species beating other kinds of biome combined

The desert city of Phoenix Arizona is named for the mythical desert bird that burns to death only to be reborn rising from its own ashes
The city of Phoenix was built on top of the ruins of canals built by the Hohokam people between 500 and 1450 CE
The Hohokam used the canals to irrigate their crops
Modern-day residents also rely on an extensive canal system to provide irrigation

Deserts are some of the harshest places on Earth
While  can live off the land in several severe climates being stranded in the desert is virtually a death sentence for even the most capable wilderness survivor
Deserts conjure up specific ideas about topography typically that they are dry and sandy dunes or rock or a mixture of both
But deserts are far more than this and there are multiple types
How we define the desert biome are not about the types of rock or the amount of sand or even the temperature because there are both cold and hot deserts
The simple explanation is that deserts are topographic landscapes that receive little precipitation in a typical year
The threshold is 10 inches or 25cm
But more than simply having low rainfall a desert is arid
This means a high rate of water loss through plant reclamation called transpiration and through evaporation
These two aspects are combined into something called evapotranspiration
This is the amount of water that the landscape would lose when available
For deserts evapotranspiration ratio exceeds average annual rainfall by anything from 21 to 331
The higher the ratio the less available moisture there is
The coarse nature of the soil means most moisture seeps through the top soil rapidly

The mulga tree has a unique adaptation that enables it to grow in the desert biome
This tree has small leaves that grow upward and act as funnels when it rains
The water moves down the leaves and falls to the base of the tree where it can be soaked up by the shallow root system
This adaptation helps the plant ensure that it will get as much water as possible when it rains

Dont GoDeserts are some of the most extreme environments found on earth
Scorching temperatures and water scarcity make it all but impossible for most animals to live there
Yet some animals thrive in these harsh conditions
Here are six such animals
Despite harsh conditions some animals thrive in hot dry desert climates
These animals include fennec foxes dung beetles Bactrian camels Mexican coyotes sidewinder snakes and thorny devil lizards
Fennec foxes inhabit the Saharan desert in Africa where temperatures average around 104 degrees Fahrenheit
Their large ears dispel heat by filtering blood through small capillaries in the thin ear tissue spreading it out and cooling it before it is circulated back into the rest of the body
Fennec foxes have thick fur on the soles of their feet which allows them to run over hot desert sand without pain
Like many desert creatures they have developed nocturnal habits so they are most active after the scorching desert sun goes down
While out and about at night fennec foxes feast on smaller desert animals such as beetles and lizards
There are several species of dung beetles but most of them live in the deserts of Australia and Africa
Famously these beetles feed exclusively on the dung of larger animals
Though it may seem gross eating dung is a good choice for a small desert creature like a beetle
In the hot dry desert moisture of any kind is hard to find
Dung contains moisture from the gut of the animal that expelled it
Instead of searching for rare watering holes the way wildebeest and antelope do dung beetles wait for these larger animals to do the work of finding water for them
By eating dung they get all the advantages of the water found by others without needing to do any of the work
Create the almost perfect bracket This doesnt mean that dung beetles live a life of leisure
Many species spend long hours shaping dung into perfect orbs which they then roll across the desert to their burrows
Depending on the size of the dung ball it can provide enough food and moisture to keep a beetle alive for more than a week
Most dung beetles are active at dawn and dusk when desert temperatures are relatively cool
During the height of midday they burrow into the sand to escape the heat
Their glossy exoskeletons reflect sunlight which prevents them from becoming too hot
Camels are some of the most famous desert animals
While some species have only one hump Bactrian camels have two
These humps serve the same function as those of single-humped camels They store energy-rich fat which sustains the camels during long treks across the desert
Many people used to believe that camel humps contained water which isnt true
Its easy to understand why someone might believe this since camels can go up to seven months without drinking water
In contrast a human can only survive for three to five days without water in temperate conditions
Besides their humps and drinking habits or lack thereof camels come equipped with even more adaptations for desert life
Their wide tough feet can withstand the heat of desert sand even at temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit
They rarely sweat which conserves water and their long eyelashes and bushy eyebrows keep blowing sand out of their eyes
Mexican coyotes are one of several coyote subspecies
As their name implies they live in the deserts of Mexico as well as in California and Arizona mostly in the Sonoran Desert
Although coyotes are sometimes confused with wolves these desert canines are much smaller usually weighing only about 30 pounds at full adulthood
Like fennec foxes coyotes use their large ears to cool their bodies
However their most useful desert adaptation may well be their diet
Coyotes are opportunistic eaters which means they will eat as much as they can whenever they can and they can eat just about anything in their environment
Insects small rodents reptiles and vegetarian fare such as cactus fruit and flowers
Coyotes usually live alone but they can form packs with other coyotes to hunt large prey if the opportunity arises
This flexibility allows coyotes to be successful desert dwellers
Sidewinders are one of many snake species native to deserts of the southwestern U
and northwestern Mexico
These legless reptiles get their name from their unique way of moving
Instead of slithering side to side in a straight line as most snakes do sidewinders slither diagonally whipping their bodies back and forth in long strokes
This movement allows them to move quickly and with good traction even over loose shifting desert sand
Like all snakes sidewinders are predators
They prey on smaller desert creatures including rodents and small reptiles
During certain parts of the year when temperatures are particularly high sidewinders change their sleeping habits and become nocturnal
During cooler parts of the year they remain active during the day
The thorny devil also known as the thorny dragon is a lizard specially equipped for life in the deserts of Australia
They are named for the protruding thornlike growths that cover their skin
These sharp growths are effective at keeping predators such as birds and larger lizards away
Amazingly their thorns also help them collect water
Like plant stalks the thorns become covered with dew each morning
The thorny devil drinks this dew which keeps it from having to hunt for water in the desert
The thorny devil has a unique way of hunting which conserves energy
Instead of going after prey to hunt thorny devils position themselves by ant hills bury themselves partially in the sand and wait for prey to come to them
As ants wander by thorny devils snatch them up one by one

They are some of the harshest environments on earth but deserts are still teeming with life and desert animals that have adapted to extreme conditions
To conserve water a lot of animals dont urinate and most dont even drink water - they extract moisture from the plants and creatures they eat
What animals live in the desert There are all kinds of desert creatures that are super cool even if their habitats are hot as blazes
As the summer temperatures continue to climb you may find yourself spending more and more time indoors enjoying the comforts of central air conditioning
But without the benefit of modern technology animals that make their home in the heat have had to come up with their own ways of staying cool and hydrated
We caught up with San Diego Zoo Ambassador and Zookeeper Rick Schwartz between television appearances in New York City to talk about the incredible ways that some creatures have adapted to survive in the desert
Summer is the perfect time to channel your inner

There are various types of deserts all around the world from the harsh elements of the Sahara desert in Africa to the deserts of the Southwestern United States
The Sahara is the worlds largest hot desert and is located in North Africa
It stretches over  all the way across the northern part of the continent Temperatures there can approach and even  a blistering 130F 54

It can also go below freezing Some of the animals of the Sahara include Dromedary Camels  the Addax Dama Gazelles and Saharan Horned Vipers
The Sonoran is one of 4 large deserts located in the Southwestern United States
It is located in parts of California Arizona and Northern Mexico
While it is the hottest of the deserts in the U
it contains much more plant life than the Sahara
The Saguaro Cactus is one such example
Animals that can be found in the Sonoran include the  the Desert Bighorn Sheep the Cactus Wren the  and the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake
The Atacama is located in various parts of Chile a long narrow country in South America that borders the Pacific Ocean
The Atacama receives very very little rain and is described as the  place on Earth
Some areas of the Atacama have  had any recorded rain in  Plant and animal life in the Atacama are extremely scarce

A good example of an animal with special adaptations is the camel
A  can drink very large amounts of water in one day or survive for a relatively long time without drinking any water
Our planet has climates of all kinds from raw winters to soft springs
These different types of climate and variety of geographical areas are so great that in each one different species of fauna and flora can be found
But what kind of animals exist in the desert is one of the largest deserts in the world
It is located in North Africa and some of its sand dunes can reach almost two hundred meters in height
It is an arid and dry desert where you can find some oasis around which certain types of animal and plant life have developed
Among the animals we can find in this desert are occupies around 40 of the total surface of the country
There in fact four deserts in different parts of the country San Luis de Potosi Baja California Sonora and Chihuahua
Some of these beautiful deserts are not only part of Mexico but also of the United States
You can find several deserts in Chile
The most popular is the  located in the north of the country
It is the most arid desert in the world
This area is rich in metallic non-metallic resources and magnesium salt which is an important source for the Chilean economy
when the rainfall in the area exceeds the annual average a natural known phenomenon occurs
This phenomenon is called the flowery desert
Contrary to what most people think and a surprising  for many is that
The word desert does not only mean arid areas where heat reigns but any inhospitable space where life is scarce due to adverse conditions

Desert Climate is generally dry and hot with low humidity
Temperatures can drop quite low at night because heat that arrives during the day with no clouds to hold it in escapes into the atmosphere at night
In some deserts in Saudi Arabia temperature can drop below freezing as late as April
In the hottest deserts in the winter temperatures can rise to the 90s F 30s C in the day and drop to the 30s F single digits C at night

The  biome is a dry terrestrial biome
It consists of habitats that receive very little rainfall each year generally less than 50 centimeters
The  covers about one-fifth of the Earths surface and includes regions at a variety of latitudes and elevations
The desert biome is divided into four basic types of desertsarid deserts semi-arid deserts coastal deserts and cold deserts
Each of these types of deserts is characterized by different physical characteristics such as aridity climate location and temperature
Although deserts are highly varied there are some general characteristics that can be described
The fluctuation in the temperature throughout a day in a desert is far more extreme than the daily temperature fluctuations in more humid climates
The reason for this is that in damper climates humidity in the air buffers the daytime and nighttime temperatures
But in deserts the dry air heats up considerably during the day and cools off quickly at night
The low atmospheric humidity in deserts also means there is often a lack of cloud cover to hold the warmth
Rainfall in deserts is also unique
When it does rain in arid regions precipitation often comes in short bursts that are separated by long periods of drought
The rain that falls evaporates quicklyin some hot arid deserts rain sometimes evaporates before it hits the ground
The soils in deserts are often coarse in texture
They are also rocky and dry with good drainage
Desert soils experience little weathering
The plants that grow in deserts are shaped by the arid conditions in which they live
Most desert-dwelling plants are low-growing in stature and have tough leaves that are well-suited to conserve water
Desert plants include vegetation such as yuccas agaves brittlebushes lack sage prickly pear cacti and saguaro cactus
The following are the key characteristics of the desert biomeThe desert biome is classified within the following habitat hierarchy Desert BiomeThe desert biome is divided into the following habitatsSome of the animals that inhabit the desert biome includeThere was an error

Dont GoA biome is an ecosystem that includes specific characteristics relative to temperature climate plant life and animal life
A desert is just one of eight major biomes on Earth
Though some of the Earths biomes look very similar to each other some have very distinct appearances and characteristics
A desert is one biome that is vastly different from the other seven
The climate of a desert is hot and dry
The main reason for this hot climate is that deserts are tropical biomes and are exposed to virtually direct sunlight
The amount of rain in the desert varies slightly from desert to desert but on average desert rainfall measures about 1 inch per year
Although the desert climate is very hot and dry there is an abundance of animal life
Varieties of lizards rats owls tortoises antelopes and bobcats are just a few of the many desert dwelling animals that have had to evolve to survive
Each of these animals have evolved so that water preservation escape from the elements and dietary concerns are not problems even in the harsh environment
Create the almost perfect bracket You might expect a desert to be a place where little plant life exists
However there are thousands of plants that flourish in a desert biome
The two most numerous are the ocotillo a flowering plant and the saguaro cactus
Desert plants typically have shallow but extensive root systems
Desert plants also have either a capacity for water storage or have evolved so that their demand for water is relatively low
The vast majority of the geographic features in the desert include only sand or rocks and gravel
Vegetation although diverse is scare
Though there are sand dunes that appear as hills the lie of the land is flat
A water-rich ecosystem that can be found in the desert is called an oasis
An oasis is fed by underwater streams and often occurs in a low enough area so that the water table can be tapped

They are found at the lower latitudes between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
Light winds occur often which evaporates any type of moisture that is typically going to develop in them
The heat is very dry and that makes it hard for too many types of plants or animals to be able to survive in such biomes

The temperate forest  is one of the worlds major habitats
Temperate forests are characterized as regions with high levels of precipitation humidity and a variety of
Deciduous trees are trees that lose their leaves in winter
Decreasing temperatures and shortened daylight hours in fall mean decreased  for plants
Thus these trees shed their leaves in fall and bud new leaves in spring when warmer temperatures and longer hours of daylight return
have a wide range of temperatures that correlate with the distinctive seasons
Temperatures range from hot in the summer with highs of 86 degrees Fahrenheit to extremely cold in the winter with lows of -22 degrees Fahrenheit
Temperate forests receive abundant amounts of precipitation usually between 20 and 60 inches of precipitation annually
This precipitation is in the form of rain and snow
Deciduous forests are typically found in the Northern Hemisphere
Some locations of temperate forests includeDue to abundant rainfall and thick soil humus temperate forests are able to support a wide variety of  life and vegetation
This vegetation exists in several layers ranging from lichens and mosses on the ground layer to large tree species like oak and hickory that stretch high above the forest floor
Other examples of temperate forest vegetation includeMosses are  that play an important ecological role in the biomes they inhabit
These small dense plants often resemble green carpets of vegetation
They thrive in moist areas and help to prevent soil erosion and also serve as a source of insulation during colder months
Unlike mosses lichens are not plants
They are the result of symbiotic relationships between  or cyanobacteria and
Lichens are important decomposers in this environment littered with decaying plant material
Lichens help to recycle plant leaves thus generating the fertile soil in this biome
Temperate forests are home to a diverse wildlife biosystem including various  and  wolves foxes bears coyotes bobcats mountain lions eagles rabbits deer skunks squirrels raccoons squirrels moose  and hummingbirds
Temperate forest animals have many different ways to deal with the cold and lack of food in winter
Some animals hibernate during the winter and arise in spring when food is more plentiful
Other animals store food and burrow underground to escape the cold
Many animals escape the harsh conditions by migrating to warmer regions in winter
Other animals have adapted to this environment by blending in with the forest
Some  looking almost indistinguishable from the foliage
This type of adaptation comes in handy for both predators and prey

Deserts are characterized by their rainfallor rather their lack of it
Most deserts get less than ten inches of precipitation each year and evaporation usually exceeds rainfall
Deserts regions where more water evaporates from the ground than is replaced by precipitation are generally extremely hot but some like the Gobi in Asia experience very cold winters
And deserts that are hot during the day may become cold at night because they lack the insulation provided by clouds and humidity
The world is already 1 C hotter than it was between 1850 and 1900
Theres no question that limiting warming to 1
5 F will be difficult but we have the technology needed to succeed
Deserts may lack water but they dont lack life
Shrubs and plants have evolved to minimize water loss and effectively manage the little water they do get
Animal diversity is also highespecially among reptile species that are particularly well suited to hot dry conditions
Deserts come in many forms
There are the endless scorching sand dunes of the Sahara the flower-rich deserts of Namibia and the cactus-diverse Chihuahuan desert of North America
The worlds largest desert is neither hot nor sandyits the frozen continent of Antarctica
Rising temperatures could make deserts an even more uncomfortable place to live than they are now
Precipitation will become even scarcer
Drinking water for 500 million people who live in deserts is either disappearing or becoming too salty as snowpacks and glaciers that feed desert rivers melt
And deserts will expand towards communities as evaporation increases and dust storms multiply
Resourcesespecially watercan be hard to come by in desert landscapes
Growing human populations put increasing pressure on those resources
Water is a precious thing in a desert and many have stores of it deep underground
But these stores are vulnerable to overextraction when they receive little water to recharge them every year
Water is the lifeblood of the desert
WWF works to preserve and restore the freshwater ecosystems that are home to many of the deserts most spectacular plant and animal species
For example in the Chihuahuan desertstretching from the southwestern United States into the Central Mexican highlandsWWF focuses on the Rio GrandeRio Bravo basin
We work to ensure water flow is sufficient to meet the environmental needs of the areas plants and animals including jaguars and black bears
Human exploitation of fragile ecosystems can lead to the droughts and arid conditions characteristic of desertification
Effects include land degradation soil erosion and sterility and a loss of biodiversity with huge economic costs for nations where deserts are growing
To prevent desert expansion WWF has worked to preserve and restore ecosystems in danger of desertification
WWF and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation are the first partners in an initiative to protect Peru which is based on an innovative funding approach called Project Finance for Permanence that has been used in Brazil
The goal of the initiative is to ensure the long-term sustainability of the public land within Perus network of protected areas

About one-third of Earth is covered with forest
This represents two-thirds of the  area of all the land plants
The forests contain about 70 of the Earths carbon stores as well
Deciduous forests contain trees that lose their leaves once per year
In temperate deciduous forests this happens in the fall and in tropical and subtropical deciduous forests the leaves fall in the dry season
Hot deserts are an important ecosystem with distinct characteristics and adaptations
They provide opportunities for development but also cause challenges such as desertification

Dont GoPicture a desert in your mind and youll probably envision a hot dry landscape with intense sunlight
Right there you have many of the key abiotic factors that influence the desert ecosystem
In addition the type of soil is also an important factor sandy deserts are common but there are other soil types as well
Limited water is a defining feature of desert ecosystems and their most profound environmental constraint
Typically deserts receive less than 508 millimeters 20 in
of rain per year
This means that animals and plants looking to survive in the desert must be able to live with little water for extended periods of time
For example cacti have evolved to store water in their stems to help them through dry spells
Deserts typically go through huge fluctuations in temperature during a 24-hour period
Because there is little moisture deserts lack the insulating protection of both humidity and cloud cover
A desert that is hot during the day may drop to well below zero degrees at night once the heat of the sun has left
Organisms that cannot adapt well to rapid temperature fluctuations have trouble surviving in the desert
Create the almost perfect bracket The type of soil in an ecosystem determines what plants can grow which in turn defines which animals can survive
Desert soil types vary greatly influencing a given locations drainage as well as evaporation
Water may seep deeply in sandy or gravelly substrate but barely penetrate hard-packed clay or exposed bedrock
Depending on the substrate and the intensity of precipitation or flow rainfall or runoff may sink quickly into desert soil or form sudden flash floods producing significant erosion
Desert sunlight can be intense courtesy of prevailing cloud-free conditions and in the subtropics the position of the sun
Barren flats such as pebbly desert pavement or reg may be blindingly bright
In other desert landscapes more convoluted terrain such as sand dunes and mountain ranges or more substantial plant cover such as forests of tree-sized cacti ensure more complex patterns of light and shadow
The degree and intensity of sunlight in a given spot helps shape its microclimate and thus profoundly affects plants and animals

The management of forests is known as   and
A forest  is a natural woodland unit consisting of all plants animals and micro-organisms  in that area functioning together with all of the non-living physical  factors of the environment
The forest ecosystem is very important
Reference Number 18

This is where you can find research-based information from Americas land-grant universities enabled by
A  is the basic ecologic unit in a particular forest that exists as home for a community of both native and introduced classified organisms
A forest ecosystem is named for the primary tree species that form the canopy
It is defined by all the collective living inhabitants of that forest ecosystem that co-exist together in symbiosis to create a unique ecology
In other words a forest ecosystem is typically associated with land masses covered in trees and those trees are often classified by foresters into
Examples of just a few broad names in North America are The northern hardwood ecosystem the ponderosa pine ecosystem the bottomland hardwood forest ecosystem the jack pine forest ecosystem and so on
The forest ecosystem is just one of a number of unique ecosystems including prairies deserts polar regions and great oceans smaller lakes and rivers
The word ecology comes from the Greek oikos meaning household or place to live
These ecosystems or communities are usually self-sustaining
The word usually is used because some of these communities can become unbalanced very quickly when detrimental factors occur
Some ecosystems like tundra  wetlands and grasslands are very fragile and very small changes can affect their health
Larger ecosystems with wide diversity are much more stable and somewhat resistant to harmful changes
A forest  is directly related to species diversity
Generally you can assume that the more complex the structure the greater is its species diversity
You should remember that a forest community is much more than just the sum of its trees
A forest is a system that supports interacting units including trees soil insects animals and man
Forest ecosystems tend to always be moving toward maturity or into what foresters call a
This maturing also called forest  of the ecosystem increases diversity up to the point of old age where the system slowly collapses
One forestry example of this is the growth of trees and the entire system moving toward an
When an ecosystem is exploited and exploitation is maintained or when components of the forest begin to naturally die then that maturing forest ecosystem goes into declining tree health
Management of forests for sustainability is desirable when forest diversity is threatened by overuse resource exploitation old age and poor management
Forest ecosystems can be disrupted and harmed when not properly sustained
A  by a qualified certification program gives some assurance that the forest is managed to allow maximum diversity while satisfying the managers environmental and economic demands
Scientists and foresters have dedicated their entire careers trying to understand even a small part of forest ecosystems
Complex forest ecosystems are extremely diverse ranging from dry desert shrub land to large temperate rain forests
These natural resource professionals have categorized forest ecosystems in North America by placing them into
Forest biomes are broad categories of natural treeplant communities

The health and vitality of our plants and wildlife are essential to our lives even beyond forest and grassland boundaries
Every regions of our country is being invaded by invasive plants animals insects and pathogens
They can the environment economy and each of us
Learn how you can help
Plant species are invasive when they are nonnative to the area where found and are capable of causing environmental economic or human harm
Temperate deciduous forests have a great variety of plant species
Most have three levels of plants
Lichen moss ferns wildflowers and other small plants can be found on the forest floor
Shrubs fill in the middle level and hardwood trees like maple oak birch magnolia sweet gum and beech make up the third level
Conifers like spruce fir and pine trees can also be found mixed in with the hardwood trees in this biome
Sometimes the taiga and the temperate deciduous forest overlap
Forests play a critical role in mitigating climate change because they soak up carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate patterns
Forests are essential for life on earth
Three hundred million people worldwide live in forests and 1
6 billion depend on them for their livelihoods
Forests also provide habitat for a vast array of plants and animals many of which are still undiscovered
They protect our watersheds
They inspire wonder and provide places for recreation
They supply the oxygen we need to survive
They provide the timber for products we use every day
Forests cover one-third of the worlds land surfacemore than 15
3 million square miles
Every forest is different but some share common traits based on the local climate
In fact every forest on the planet can fit into one of four categories
Millions of people around the world depend on forests for hunting gathering and medicine forest products such as rubber and rattan and small-scale agriculture
Deforestation can disrupt the lives of local communities sometimes with devastating consequences
Forests provide a vast array of resources to all of us including food wood medicine fresh water and the air we breathe
Without the trees species can disappear the natural water balance can become disrupted and the ecosystem that supports the human population can fall apart
Forest trees and other plants soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it away as they grow and thrive
Tropical forests alone hold more than 210 gigatons of carbon seven times the amount emitted each year by human activities
Eighty percent of the worlds known terrestrial plant and animal species can be found in forests and tropical rainforests are home to more species than any other terrestrial habitat
A square kilometer of forest may be home to more than 1000 species
A palm oil plantation in Borneo Malaysia shows deforested land
As the human population continues to grow there is an obvious need for more food
In addition agricultural products such as soy and palm oil are used in an ever-increasing list of products from animal feed to lipstick and biofuels
Rising demand has created incentives to convert forests to farmland and pasture land
Once a forest is lost to agriculture it is usually gone foreveralong with many of the plants and animals that once lived there
Illegal logging in Sumatra
National laws regulate the production and trade of timber products at all stages from harvesting to processing to sales
These laws can be violated in any number of ways such as taking wood from protected areas harvesting more than is permitted and harvesting protected species
Illegal logging occurs around the world and in some places illegal logging is more common than the legal variety
This destruction threatens some of the worlds most famous and valuable forests including rainforests in the Amazon Congo Basin Indonesia and the forests of the Russian Far East
Illegal logging also depresses the price of timber worldwide disadvantaging law-abiding companies and depriving governments of revenues normally generated by duties and taxes
Poor communities near forests are often vulnerable when outsiders try to gain control over the timber nearby which can lead to repression and human rights violations
Forest on fire in the Amazon Brazil
Fires are a natural and beneficial part of the forest landscape but they can be a problem when they occur in the wrong place at the wrong frequency or at the wrong severity
Each year millions of acres of forest around the world are destroyed or degraded by fire
The same amount is lost to logging and agriculture combined
Fire is often used as a way to efficiently and inexpensively clear land for other uses such as planting crops
These fires not only alter the structure and composition of forests but they can also open up the forests to invasive species threaten biological diversity alter water cycles and soil fertility and destroy the livelihoods of the people who live in and around the forests
Wood is still a popular fuel choice for cooking and heating around the world and about half of the illegal removal of timber from forests is thought to be for use as fuelwood
WWF works to create protected areas which have been key to the preservation of some species such as the mountain gorillas that live in the forests of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa
To combat illegal logging and promote responsible forestry WWF created the Global Forest Trade Network GFTN
GFTN links hundreds of companies forest-dependent communities non-governmental organizations and entrepreneurs in more than 30 countries around the world with the goal of creating a market for environmentally responsible forest products
GFTN works at national and regional levels to expand the area of forests under responsible and credibly certified forest management
It also works to encourage demand for good wood wood and paper products from those well-managed forests
GFTN helps participants benefit from sustainable forest management and reduce demand for products from illegal and controversial sources
As a result of this program habitat has been preserved for endangered species such as the Borneo pygmy elephant orangutan and great apes
WWFs Global Forest Trade Network GFTN works at national and regional levels to ensure the legal harvest of timber
Here a man marks legally harvested timber
Eliminating all deforestation is not possible
Parts of the landscape will need to be reshaped and altered as populations grow and changebut this can be balanced through sustainable forest management reforestation efforts and maintaining the integrity of protected areas
Given the amount of deforestation around the world zero net deforestation may seem unattainable
However it is not only possible but necessary if we intend to preserve our most precious wildlife respect and empower local communities maintain critical ecosystem services and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Some nations are already finding success
Paraguay for example reduced the rate of deforestation in their country by 85 in the years just following enactment of its 2004 Zero Deforestation Law
WWF advocates for governments international bodies and other stakeholders to make zero net deforestation a reality by 2020
If carbon emissions from deforestation were taken into account Brazil and Indonesia would rank in the top 10 of the worlds worst polluters
WWF has a program focus on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries and the conservation sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks called REDD
These efforts will also address many of the drivers of deforestation and provide incentives for nations to protect their forests while safeguarding the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples
Securing forest ecosystems as parks and other protected areas can help to preserve their valuable plants and animals for future generations
Protected areas have proved key to the preservation of some species such as the mountain gorillas that live in the forests of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa
In addition to protecting biodiversity the Amazon Region Protected Areas program has demonstrated that a system of well-managed and sustainably-financed protected areas contributes to reduced CO2 emissions from deforestation
WWF has worked to create and continue support for protected areas in more than 100 countries around the world
Biomass from forestry and farming has the potential to become a major source for sustainable power generation
Humans have used forests for fuel for thousands of years and 2
6 billion people today still use biomassmainly wood and charcoalfor cooking
WWF works to promote bioenergy from scrap wood oil and fats sugar and starch crops residues and wastes and even algae to reduce reliance on forests and decrease greenhouse gas emissions
WWFs vision is that by 2050 100 of the worlds energy will come from sustainable renewable sources including bioenergy
Illegal logging includes the harvesting transporting processing buying or selling of timber in violation of national laws
WWF uses several approaches to tackle illegal logging
One is ensuring that powerful policies and trade agreements are in place in the US and other countries
WWF also provides guidance on best practices related to legality and responsible sourcing to hundreds of companies around the world including in the US and supports an alliance that monitors the status of the remaining natural forests in Sumatras province of Riau
We too we encourage US consumers to buy wood products that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council
Forests in Asia home to elephants tigers and other endangered speciesare often cleared to make room for growing rubber trees
They are among the most threatened forests in the world

Bhutan is at the heart of the Eastern Himalayas which supplies one-third of the worlds freshwater

Dont GoKnowing which plants and animals commonly inhabit forests could make woodland walks more interesting and satisfying and improve your understanding of the world
The variety of flora and fauna found in tree-dense areas depends very much on the type of forest and what part of the world it is in
People in the U
are most familiar with deciduous forests as these are commonplace in the eastern states as well as across Europe and parts of Asia
Deciduous forests grow in areas with quite temperate climates so animals and plants that live there are adapted for colder conditions
Some of the creatures that inhabit deciduous forests include brown and black bears foxes raccoons and grey squirrels
The trees lose their leaves in the fall and depending on where in the world the forest lies may include species such as red and white oak yellow buckeye white basswood American beech and white ash
Smaller plants include Dutchmans breeches sassafras and redbud
Rainforests grow in the areas around the equator including Central and South America Africa southern Asia and Australia
The climate in these places is very hot and humid and the animals and plants that live there have adapted to these conditions
Although the rainforests only cover 6 percent of Earths surface over half of all the species of fauna and flora in the world live there
Animals inhabiting rainforests include boa constrictors spider monkeys toucans gorillas jaguars sloths and macaws
Plants of the rainforest include strangler figs which grow up trees and wrap around them until they die vines called lianas orchids and passionflowers
Create the almost perfect bracket Temperate rainforests are not as widespread as their tropical counterparts
They grow in some parts of New Zealand and Chile but are most common on the northwest coast of North America from southern Alaska to California
Animals that inhabit these areas include coyotes deer and bears as well as blue grouse and another bird called Clarks nutcracker
Coniferous trees like western red cedar mountain hemlock lodgepole pine and Douglas fir are common here
Other plants include the Indian paintbrush and various mosses and lichens
Boreal forests exist in North America Europe and Asia
The climate is cold with heavy snowfall which affects which animals and plants live there
Animals that live in these areas include elk snowshoe hares porcupines bobcats and amur tigers
Coniferous trees are the dominant species including pines larches hemlocks spruces and firs
Various forms of mosses and lichens also grow in boreal forests

are magnificent places teeming with a huge diversity of life
They are essential for life on Earth
They impact our lives in so many ways from the air we breathe to the wood we use
Eight of 10 species found on land live in forests and almost 300 million people particularly in developing countries live in forests too
live in lowland and mountainous rainforests in Papua New Guinea Indonesia and the far north of Queensland Australia
They have adapted to life in the trees with shorter legs and stronger forelimbs for climbing
They are the largest tree-dwelling mammals in Australia
Like all macropods instead of sweating tree kangaroos lick their forearms and allow the evaporation to help cool their bodies when hot
Many tree kangaroo species are incredibly rare and most are decreasing in number
They face habitat loss through deforestation
live mainly in bamboo forests high in the mountains of western China where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo
They play a crucial role in the bamboo forests by spreading seeds and facilitating growth of vegetation
Pandas suffer from habitat loss due to the construction of roads and railroads which fragment the forest isolating panda populations and preventing mating as well as reducing pandas access to the bamboo they need to survive
WWF has been helping with the Chinese governments National Conservation Program for the giant panda and its habitat
Thanks to this program panda reserves now cover more than 3
8 million acres of forest
are one of the rarest and most threatened mammals on the planet
They are a cousin of cattle but resemble antelope
They are critically endangered and are found only in the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos
As forests disappear under the chainsaw to make way for agriculture plantations and infrastructure saola are being squeezed into smaller spaces
Rapid and large-scale infrastructure in the region is also fragmenting saola habitat
WWF has been involved with the protection of the saola since its discovery strengthening and establishing protected areas as well as working on research community based forest management capacity building and strengthening law enforcement
The name  means man of the forest in the Malay language and they are the worlds largest tree-climbing mammal
They make nests of trees of vegetation to sleep in at night and rest in during the day
They are gardeners of the forest playing a vital role in seed dispersal in their habitats
Their habitat is fast disappearing to make way for oil palm plantations and other agricultural plantations
Today more than 50 of orangutans are found outside protected areas in forests under management by timber palm oil and mining companies
Orangutans live on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra
The island of Sumatra has lost 85 of its forests and a similar level of destruction is taking place on the island of Borneo
WWF works in Borneo and Sumatra to secure well-managed protected areas and wider forest landscapes to connect sub-populations of orangutans
inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa
They are smaller than African savanna elephants with more oval-shaped ears and straighter tusks that point downward
By eating more fruits from more tree species than probably any other large vertebrate forest elephants are essential for the dispersal and germination of many rain forest trees
For some of these species their seeds will only germinate after passing through the elephants digestive tract
In short elephants are true forest gardeners
Their range has been shrinking rapidly from 3 million square miles in 1979 to less than 1 million square miles today
Poaching has further decimated their remaining populations by over 65 from 2002 to 2013
These elephants are being pushed into smaller islands of protected areas further hindering their freedom to roam and long term survival

The forest biome includes terrestrial habitats that are dominated by trees and other woody plants
Today forests cover about one-third of the worlds land surface and are found in many different terrestrial regions around the globe
There are three general types of foreststemperate forests tropical forests and boreal forests
Each of these forest types differs in climate species composition and community structure
The forests of the world have changed in composition over the course of evolution
The first forests evolved during the  about 400 million years ago
These ancient forests were very different than present-day forests and were dominated not by the species of trees we see today but instead by giant ferns horsetails and club mosses
As the evolution of land plants progressed the species composition of forests changed
During the  gymnosperms such as  cycads  and gnetales dominated forests
By the Cretaceous Period angiosperms such as  had evolved
Although the flora fauna and structure of forests vary greatly they often can be broken down into several structural layers
These include the forest floor herb layer shrub layer understory canopy and emergents
The forest floor is the ground layer that is often covered with decaying plant material
The herb layer consists of herbaceous plants such as grasses ferns and wildflowers
The shrub layer is characterized by the presence of woody vegetation such as bushes and brambles
The understory consists of immature and small trees that are shorter than the main canopy layer
The canopy consists of the crowns of mature trees
The emergent layer includes the crowns of the tallest trees which grow above the rest of the canopy
The following are the key characteristics of the forest biomeThe forest biome is classified within the following habitat hierarchy Forest BiomeTemperate forests are forests that grow in temperate regions such as those found in eastern North America western and central Europe and northeastern Asia
Temperate forests have a moderate climate and a growing season that lasts between 140 and 200 days of the year
Precipitation is generally distributed evenly throughout the year
Tropical forests are forests that grow in tropical and subtropical regions
These include  such as those found in the  and the Congo Basin and tropical dry forests such as those found in southern Mexico the lowlands of Bolivia and the western regions of Madagascar
Boreal forests are a band of coniferous forests that encircle the globe in the high northern latitudes between about 50N and 70N
Boreal forests form a circumpolar ecoregion that stretches across Canada and extends across northern Europe and Asia
Boreal forests are the worlds largest terrestrial biome and account for more than one-quarter of all the forested land on Earth

Biome Map Worksheet
Dont GoApproximately 30 percent of the earths surface is covered in all different types of forests according to Elizabeth Mygatt author of the article Worlds Forests Continue to Shrink
Mygatt goes on to further explain the crucial role that the forest ecosystem plays in maintaining a healthy planet such as controlling the water cycle and stabilizing soils assisting in leveling the climate by saturating and storing carbon dioxide providing a habitat for wildlife and supplying wood food and medicines
Across the world there are several different kinds of forests
The textbook definition of ecosystem as stated in Elemental Geosystems is a self-regulating association of living plants animals and their non-living physical and chemical environment
In a tropical rainforest days usually last 12 hours with temperatures averaging around 77 degrees F
A surplus of rain and high insolation sunlight are other year-round attributes of a tropical rainforest
Tropical rainforests cover the Amazon region as well as equatorial regions in Africa Southeast Asia the east coast of Central America and elsewhere along the equator
These types of forest ecosystem are characterized by broadleaf evergreen trees vines tree ferns and palms
Many tropical rainforests are known for their incredible biodiversity
Jungles like the Amazon are home to thousands of different types of species
Those include animals that crawl along the ground like insects lizards and rodents as well as those that swing through the trees like monkeys
Tropical rainforests also house vicious predators like anacondas and jaguars
Create the almost perfect bracket Located on the edges of rainforests are the tropical seasonal forests that receive dwindling and irregular rainfall
Some of the key parts of a forest in this zone are broadleaf evergreen trees some deciduous trees and thorn trees
Deciduous trees lose their leaves during the winter
Found in North America Europe and Asia temperate evergreen and deciduous forests tend to blend together at times
Needleleaf and broadleaf trees inhabit the forests
In southern and eastern areas that are fervent with evergreen pines controlled forest fires still take place as the natural cycle of forest re-growth and enrichment
They are called temperate forests because of their weather conditions
Compared to the extreme heat and humidity of a tropical rainforest temperate evergreen and deciduous forests have moderate climates with pleasantly warm summers and bearably chilly winters
The boreal forest also known as the needleleaf forest covers most of the subarctic climate areas located in Canada Alaska Siberia Russia and Europe
Taiga is a broader term used for boreal forest in order to encompass areas transitioning to Arctic climate conditions
While there arent any boreal forests in the southern hemisphere there are mountain forests comprised of needleleaf trees that survive all over the world at extremely high elevations
Boreal forests are home to many of the plants and animals typically thought of as forest-dwellers such as foxes moose reindeer bears squirrels and wolves
Plants like fungi mosses and lichen do well in the boreal climate because they are tough enough to survive what can often be extremely cold icy winters
Savanna and woodland ecosystems have a susceptibility to fires and the ability to rejuvenate and re-grow
Prevalent in South America Africa and Australia savannas and woodlands are characterized by vast areas of grasslands bush thickets and clusters of sparse trees with flattened crowns
Because of pollution and deforestation many types of forests around the world are in need of extra protection
Its important to remember how important a role forests play in the planets ecosystem and to do what you can in order to help the conservationists fighting to protect the plants and animals that live within the worlds forests

Dont GoYou cant see the forest for the trees holds true in more ways than one
The features of a forest ecosystem range from the obvious -- enormous trees -- to the obscured -- creatures camouflaged hidden in branches or burrowed underground -- to the invisible -- essential microorganisms and nutrients
A forest ecosystem in fact encompasses all the interdependent living and nonliving components of a forest community and their environment functioning as a balanced system
The tree canopy perhaps the most distinguishing feature of a forest plays many roles in the forest ecosystem
The branches and leaves -- or needles in the case of conifers -- provide shade and a buffer from wind rain and snow for the plants and creatures below
The canopy also offers hiding and nesting places for some species of birds and arboreal mammals amphibians reptiles and invertebrates
Some tropical rainforest animals live their entire lives in the canopy never touching the ground
In tropical and temperate rainforests where atmospheric moisture or fog abounds epiphytic ferns mosses and other plants -- including orchids in tropical rainforests -- grow rootless in the canopy and in boreal forests green and black lichen hang from branches
Tropical rainforests also have an emergent layer where skyscraper-height trees poke above the canopy
The understory layer of a temperate deciduous forest blooms with smaller shade-tolerant trees and shrubs including dogwoods redbuds azaleas and blackberries many of which provide food for animals such as turkeys and deer
Dogwoods vine maples and berry shrubs also grow in temperate rainforests
Boreal forests darken their understory so deeply that it tends to be more sparse except where the forest edge meets open space
Trees and plants in the tropical rainforest understory include shorter palm trees ferns and plants like the strangler fig that climb larger trees to seek sunlight jaguars and tree frogs live in nooks of tree trunks
With less solar radiation reaching it the understory layer of a forest tends to be more humid than the canopy
Create the almost perfect bracket In springtime in temperate deciduous forests a blanket of colorful ephemeral wildflowers pokes through the leaf litter catching the brief warm and sunny spell before the canopy leafs out
In temperate rainforests slowly rotting fallen trees become nurse trees or nurse logs to new trees also making homes for amphibians and rodents ferns mosses toadstools and other fungi abound
Under the densely shaded conifers in some taiga regions sparse mosses and lichen carpet the ground and dwarf blueberries and ligonberries feed bears and other animals
Colder weather doesnt allow bacteria to decompose for very long and the acidity of conifer needles also slows decompositon so dead plant matter accumulates
Little sunlight penetrates to the tropical rainforest floor as well but hot humid weather means rapid decomposition the relatively scanty ground vegetation includes mosses and liverworts
Soil types in various forests vary widely
In temperate and tropical deciduous forests soil tends to be loamy humus-rich and very fertile from the fallen leaves that break down and add organic matter and nutrients to the soil decomposed by fungi invisible bacteria and invertebrates and earthworms which also aerate the soil
In light -- pine and larch -- taiga forests fallen conifer needles make the soil acidic and hostile to many plants water rapidly leaches nutrients through the poor soil
Soils of dark taiga forests -- spruce and hemlock -- are more nutrient-rich
In tropical rainforests rapid decomposition means little organic matter stays in the generally nutrient-poor soil
In all forests tree and plant roots spread deep into the ground to take in water and essential nutrients including nitrogen fixed by bacteria
Where there is a winter season many animals -- including winter-hibernating mammals amphibians insects and reptiles -- burrow underground for shelter and food in forest ecosystems

Youve probably heard of or maybe even seen the massive die-offs of fish that sometimes occur in lakes and coastal areas worldwide
But do you know what one major cause of fish die-offs is Hypoxia or extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen in water
When water is hypoxic the low amount of oxygen can severely damage and even kill hundreds to thousands of fish at once

Health information A-ZBupa health blogHealth hubsBack to topExpert reviewer Dr Adrian Raby General PractitionerNext review due July 2020If your child has a fever they will have a body temperature of 38C or above
They may feel or look generally unwell
Your child may not be as active and engaged and they may not want to eat or drink
With our GP services we aim to give you an appointment the same day subject to availability
You can see whether your child has a fever by checking their temperature using a thermometer
You can do this yourself at home
Fever is often caused by a viral infection and will get better on its own
So treating your childs fever may mean doing nothing except keeping them comfortable and waiting for them to get better
There are many conditions that can cause a fever in children
Most fevers in children are caused by viral and bacterial infections
These can include coughs colds flu and other viruses and throat ear chest and urine infections
Rarely a fever can be a sign of a serious illness such as meningitis or septicaemia
You become dehydrated when there isnt enough water in your body and children are more likely to get dehydrated than adults
Your child can lose a lot of fluid if they have a fever so its important to check for signs of dehydration
Yes immunisation can sometimes cause fever
Some immunisations such as tetanus can cause a fever within a few hours
Others such as MMR may lead to fever a few days or a week later
Febrile seizures can happen in children under the age of five
Theyre caused by a very high temperature
Although they can be frightening they arent usually harmful
Stay with your child throughout the seizure to keep them safe and get medical advice once the seizure is over

The ecosystemHello friends and welcome to a new Happy Learning video
Today we are going to learn about the ecosystems
Butdo you know what an ecosystem is An ecosystem is a community of living things in a given area
For example this river is an ecosystem and is made up of water the river bed the river banks and all the living creatures which live in it such as this frog these lily pads or this shy duck which hides as soon as it sees us
An ecosystem can be very small such as this puddle or very big such as this enormous desertThe ecosystems are made up of two components the Abiotic and the Biotic components
The Abiotic components include the non-living things like the ground the climate or the water and it determines which living things can survive in an ecosystem
For example a desert is a very dry place and so only animals and plants which can survive without much water can live there like this slippery lizard or these humped back camels
On our planet there are loads of ecosystems and they are divided into aquatic and terrestrial
And these can be either aquatic or terrestrialThere are two types of aquatic ecosystems freshwater and Marine
The freshwater ones are those which have freshwater such as rivers or lakes where Lily pads otters or frogs liveWhoops and here are our friendly ducks againThe marine ecosystems are those found in the sea such as this beautiful colorful reef so full of life fish corals octopuses and many more fascinating creatures
When talking about the terrestrial ecosystems we imagine prairies large plains in the savanna were zebras or antelope like to grazejungles where trees are extremely high and are the homes for these monkeys called orangutansor even mountain ecosystems where there tends to be plenty of snow
Well now we know a bit more about ecosystems and as always on behalf of Happy Learning we ask you to please look after them they are so beautiful we mustnt destroy them
We must preserve themGoodbye friends and dont forget to subscribe to Happy Learning
where we hope you learn about the fascinating weather that affects us day to day
This is a great learning resource for parents and teachers
The next time you feel annoyed because it is raining again just think what life would be like if there were no rain
No grass no flowers no trees no birds no bees no life
We can feel if it is hot or cold wet or dry calm or windy
What we cannot feel is the pressure of the atmosphere
The earths atmosphere is the layer of gases which surrounds the earth
We usually just refer to this as air
Climate is a countrys normal weather over a long period of time
By climate we mean a countrys rain and sunshine winds storms and everything else that makes up the weather
Lightning is a very bright flash of electricity that happens in a thunderstorm
Clouds are made by a system of evaporation and condensation

In Asia China India Nepal and Bhutan are home to one of the eight wonders of the world and one of the most beautiful mountains in the world the Himalaya Mountains also called the Himalayas
Boasting as the worlds highest and most famous mountain peak Mt
Everest
Within the verse of the Kumarsambhava Sanskrit   Nature have provided us with fascinating landforms and features
The most often adored landforms are volcanoes
Like the perfect cone structure of Mayon Volcano in the Philippines or Mount Fiji in Japan people look at their beauty and wonder with great appreciation to nature
Volcanoes are mountains with a very disastrous nature
Their only   Taal Volcano is the second most active volcano found in the province of Batangas
A complex volcano in the middle of Taal Lake and is often called an island within a lake that is an island within a lake that is on an island as well as one of the lowest volcano in the   Mayon Volcano is one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines
Located in the southern part of Luzon about 473 kilometers 294 miles from Makati Business District of the Philippines Mount Mayon is the main landmark of the Province of Albay of Bicol Region
According to local folklore the volcano was named after Daragang The global temperature and weather is to a large extent a direct result of the suns effect to our planet
Together with the atmosphere and the rotation of the earth on its axis
The earth on which weather moves on has its own effect on the weather
The different landforms like mountains volcanoes plains and the
The Panhandle is part of the Great Plains
It is home to animals that are
depend on grasses and are adapted to live where water is less common and temperatures
can be hot or cold
Prairie
dogs are very social and live in groups called prairie dog towns
One of these towns can cover as much as 1000 acres of prairie
land
The town consists of a series of connected underground burrows
The
town is divided into wards and the wards are further divided
into coteries
A coterie consists of one adult male up to four
females and offspring up to two years of age
Prairie dogs within a ward
greet each other with bared teeth which is a kind of a kiss
and a form of recognition
These creatures have large eyes brownish-tan
fur and short tails with a black tip
They feed on grass and herbs during
the cool hours of the day
During this time they also greet and groom each
other
A sentry prairie dog always sits at the opening to a
burrow keeping watch
A bark is sounded as a warning for all to dive into
their burrows until the all clear signal is given
Prairie dogs
are an important part of the ecosystem
Other creatures use their abandoned
burrows
Rattlesnakes live in the Panhandle
Snakes help control the rodent population
Too many rodents would ruin crops so the snakes helps farmers Rattlesnakes
are venomous and usually rattle their tails before they bite
Contrary to
popular belief you cannot tell the age of a rattlesnake by the number of
rattles on its tail The rattles start to fall off after 10 rattles or segments
have been formed
Their forked tongue enables the rattlesnake to smell
Canyon land in the Panhandle is the home to the petite Palo Duro Mouse
which lives no other place but here
It has adapted to live in crevices
or cracks in the steep canyon walls
By adapting to live in these crevices
the Palo Duro Mouse is more protected from its predators
Its body
is at the most 4 inches long with a tail equally as long It is reddish
brown in color with white underneath
Primarily it eats seeds
Prickly
pear cacti are common in this semi-arid region
The prickly pear is the state
plant of Texas
It ranges from light to dark green and has pads which are
actually branches that provide photosynthesis water storage and produce
flowers
They are covered with sharp needles which are actually modified
leaves
The flowers of these cacti are yellow red or purple
It also produces
a fruit which can be cooked and eaten as can the pads
These
pads have been eaten as a vegetable in Mexico for hundreds of years

Earth has many different types of unique biomes but they fall into two main categories land and aquatic biomes

The desert biome is hot and dry
Some deserts like the northern Sahara are mostly sand with very little plant life
Other deserts like in the southwestern United States have more rocks and plant life
The wildlife in the desert must be able to survive on very little water--deserts receive less than 10 inches of rain per year 				 					To unlock this lesson you must be a Study

Tundra biome for kids
In this video enjoy pictures and video clips of this cold biome
The tundra can be divided into two types
The arctic tundra and the alpine tundra
The arctic tundra is found in the north near the poles and is very cold and treeless
The alpine tundra is found at the top of mountains and has a similar climate as the arctic tundra
In North America you will find the arctic tundra in Alaska and some cities would include Barrow Alaska Aklavik Fort McPherson Inuvik Iqaluit Old Crow Qausuittuq and Tuktoyaktuk
These cities are all on the northernmost frontier in the Northwest Territories the Nunavut provinces and the Yukon Territory
Each of these cities has very long winters and short summers
The alpine tundra can be found in the rocky mountains Alps and Pyrenees mountains

Tundra climate is usually found between the 60-75 degree latitude lines
Tundra climate is mainly found along the coast of the Arctic Ocean
Tundra is a transition climate between Ice Cap and Subarctic similar to Semiarid being a transition between Arid and more humid climate
Tundra climate areas experience a a very harsh winter and a cool summer
During the summer much of the snow and ice melts and forms soggy marshes and bogs
However some of the deeper parts of the soil stays frozen even through the summer--a layer called permafrost as in permanent-frost
The permafrost can be between 10 and 35 inches
The permafrost prevents the melted snow and ice above from draining into the ground water so marshes and bogs form
Winters are very harsh in Tundra climate
Winter months temperatures are usually between -18 and -50 degrees
Summer temperatures range from 35-50 degrees
High latitudes are the main cause of of the low temperatures
These areas mainly receive indirect sunlight
Indirect sunlight delivers light but little heat
Even during the summer Tundra mainly receives indirect sunlight which is why temperatures rarely go above 50 degrees
Tundra climates receive low levels of precipitation
Between 5-15 inches of precipitation falls every year in Tundra climates usually in the summer
The temperatures are far too low to cause significant amounts of evaporation
If Tundra received just a few less inches of precipitation it could be considered a desert
The permafrost frozen soil prevents any trees from growing here see picture below
Many different types of mosses lichens and algae grow in Tundra climate
Lichens are a mixture of algae and fungus see
Some grasses and low shrubs can also survive
The main animals found in Tundra climate are Polar Bears Musk Ox Arctic Fox Snow Owl reindeer and lemmings
Many insects and birds also exist especially during the summer
